An extensive search of Web Of knowledge, Scopus, Semantic Scholar and Google Scholar was performed. During this search, keywords related to "variable impedance control", "stability", "passivity", "safety", and "robot manipulators" were used. In this search, articles before 2010 or related to "Human-Robot interaction", "teleoperation", "soft-robotics", "hydraulic joints", and "cable joints" were filtered out. A complete list of the keywords used can be found in appendix \ref{chapter:keywords}. In addition, the citation graphs of influential articles found in the first search \cite{ferragutiTankbasedApproachImpedance2013,khaderStabilityGuaranteedReinforcementLearning2020,kronanderStabilityConsiderationsVariable2016,khansari-zadehLearningStableNonlinear2011,khansari-zadehLearningControlLyapunov2014} were inspected to check for missing articles. After these searches, the papers were manually inspected to check for relevance. The most important selection criteria were the significance of the contribution to stable variable impedance control and the technical quality of the work. If multiple studies presented a similar idea, the one with the highest technical quality was selected. If the quality was equal, the one published in a more prominent journal or with a higher citation count was selected.
