Using a fractal attractor is very promising for enforcing the passivity of variable impedance profiles online. Currently, this method has only been applied on variable impedance controllers in which only the stiffness has been varied since this is the most important for stability? (See article) Future research should focus on applying this concept to variable impedance controllers where all impedance parameters can vary.
Derive Lyapunov constraints in which the inertia does not have to be constant.
Multiple methods have been proposed to ensure robot manipulators' stability when interacting with rigid environments through VIC. Researchers used passivity filters like Farragut's energy tank to enforce the passivity of the closed-loop system during control \cite{ferragutiTankbasedApproachImpedance2013}. The benefit of this method is that it does not require any knowledge about the controlled system. The downside is that it is state-dependent and does not guarantee control performance. Researchers like \cite{kronanderStabilityConsiderationsVariable2016}have tried to solve these problems by designing passivity constraints on the variable impedance parameters that ensure a controller stays passive. Other authors have designed controllers, of which passivity is shown using a passivity analysis. Although this solves the state dependency problem and improves the performance, this method is not always feasible since it requires in-depth knowledge of the dynamic system and uncertainties. Learning-based methods have been used to overcome the above shortcomings.

This review investigated the stability considerations needed for providing safe variable impedance control for robotics manipulators in contact with (semi)-rigid environments. While the controller's stability is the most fundamental component, it is not the only component needed for safe robot interaction. Even though a stable controller will not lead to unpredictable, unstable behaviour, it can still command high velocities and accelerations, leading to unsafe situations. The controller should, therefore, also be able to adhere to certain joint or Cartesian constraints if we want it to work alongside humans or other robots safely. Future reviews should therefore focus on incorporating these additional safety constraints in the (learned) impedance control while keeping the stability and passivity relationships.

Passivity based methods have been extensively used in the impedance research for ensuring that control stable. Methods like energy

Each of these methods has their strengths and weaknesses. Where are used for are used when the are not known in advance.


The type of passivity solution depends on the task that needs to be performed. A proven passive controller like \cite{yangHumanlikeAdaptationForce2011} Yang et al. is preferable since this controller will always stay passive. Designing such a controller however is not trivial. For tasks where a offline profile is computed \cite{ferragutiTankbasedApproachImpedance2013} Ferragutis thank or the Lyapunov constraints of \cite{kronanderStabilityConsiderationsVariable2016} Kronander are very helpful. Learned controllers on the other hand do provide more customizability and are therefore preferred.


LFD methods can be divided into two main groups: transient nonlinear models and constrained optimization methods.


Currently, collision prevention is mainly handled through external collision prevention algorithms. Future research would also focus on directly incorporating these collision prevention behaviours through a constraint in learning-based methods.


Search for even less conservative passivity constraints.


In tele-operation large damping factors from constraints might degrade transparency (selvaggio)

% TODO: Can we exploid the Fractal attractor to ensure passivity of general or a subclass variable impedance profiles.

Altough the use of FA to create FIC is very promising concept for being able to use VIC. It however has not yet been applied for VIC in which also the desired inertia is varied and for which the (nonlinear) variable impedance profile is not set in advance and only . Future research should therefore focus on applying this concept to variable impedance controllers where all impedance parameters can vary and where the desired inertia is set in advance. assumption based on nonlinear profile.
Damping can be introduced as long as the desired velocity is zero.

The current FIC architectures allow for passively varying the stiffness. They use the actual robot inertia as the desired inertia. As stated, they can also be extended also to include the damping when the velocity is zero.
Not done with changing damping. Doesn't make control less passive but could improve the dynamic interaction.

% TODO: Tiseo incorperate safety bounds in potential field?

% QUESTION: Something like this?
Exact stablity method used might depend on the task you are trying to achieve. DMP for example are very easy to implement and work for tatsks that have a clear end time and can be learned from one demonstration?

LfD is a tradeoff between accuracy-stability and model/learning complexity.

Importance of global stability (see Kronander paper and papers about in practice does not happen?)


DMP easy to implement -> computationally efficient.
Constraint methods -> more complex but more accurate.
Learned constraint methods -> even more complex and time consuming but again more accurate.
Diffeomophic methods -> give more acccurate results but require to learn diffeomorphisms
contraction based methods -> Give trajectory tracking but can be over-constricting outside ot eh demonstrations.
Energy tank -> very simple but influences the accurcy online.

Out of the methods above, the diffeomorphic and contraction-based methods have shown the best accuracy. They 

SEDS-II and contraction non-convex optimization problems and therefore can have local stability optimums.

Control barrier function. This research is fundimental in the sense that it is very required to be able to have general motion AI that can be deployed in the real world.

In this review we focused on classical and learning from demonstration methods. One key learning based method however still is not concidered and reinforcement learning.

The type of passivity method depends on the task at hand. If you can verify the passivity of the task beforehand a contstraint can be used otherwise a energy-tank or potential field can be used.

This review focuses on guaranteeing stability of contact tasks. It does not focus temporary contact instabilities and oscillations than can occurring during the switch from free to contact motion \cite{khansariAdaptiveHumaninspiredCompliant2016,salehianDynamicalSystemBasedApproachControlling2018}. As these oscillations can be undesirable and hurt performance this is a very important topic and should be investigated in the future.

Although stability is a fundamental quantity for robotics control it is not the only quantity that needs to be considered to ensure robotic can be safely applied in environments with humans. Future research should also focus on methods like Lyapunov Barrier functions that can ensure other constraints like joint limits, cartesian limits and collision avoidance that ensure safety.

As stated in \ref{chapter:background} passivity is not the only method for guaranteeing stability in interaction tasks. Other methods like Input-to-state stability (ISS) and Input-to-output stability (IOS) can also be used. Future research should therefore also focus on these methods.

Several methods have been proposed to ensure free-motion and interaction stability in variable impedance control:

Where online methods are used for when the impedance profile or interaction force can not be predicted in advance. Constraint methods are used when the impedance profile is known in advance.

Authors have been improving these methods so that they are less ristrictire and a better tracking performance can be achieved. Future research should therefore focus on these methods and their improvements.
