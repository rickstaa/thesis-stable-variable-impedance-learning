        - Maar het restulaat blijft afhankelijk van hoe coservatief het contraint is.
        
        - Daarom gebruiken andere autheurs diffeomorphism om te learn in de non-lineare space maar het constraint toe te passen in een lineare space.
        - Meerdere methods.
        
        - Maar geen garantie hoe een pad naar het eind punt komt. Daarom nieuwste artikelen convergence based methods.
