  abstract = {We propose an automatic and formally sound method for synthesising Lyapunov functions for the asymptotic stability of autonomous non-linear systems. Traditional methods are either analytical and require manual effort or are numerical but lack of formal soundness. Symbolic computational methods for Lyapunov functions, which are in between, give formal guarantees but are typically semi-automatic because they rely on the user to provide appropriate function templates. We propose a method that finds Lyapunov functions fully automatically-using machine learning-while also providing formal guarantees-using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). We employ a counterexample-guided approach where a numerical learner and a symbolic verifier interact to construct provably correct Lyapunov neural networks (LNNs). The learner trains a neural network that satisfies the Lyapunov criteria for asymptotic stability over a samples set; the verifier proves via SMT solving that the criteria are satisfied over the whole domain or augments the samples set with counterexamples. Our method supports neural networks with polynomial activation functions and multiple depth and width, which display wide learning capabilities. We demonstrate our method over several non-trivial benchmarks and compare it favourably against a numerical optimisation-based approach, a symbolic template-based approach, and a cognate LNN-based approach. Our method synthesises Lyapunov functions faster and over wider spatial domains than the alternatives, yet providing stronger or equal guarantees.},

  abstract = {In order for robots to successfully carry out manipulation tasks, they require to exploit contact forces and variable impedance control. The conditions of such type of robotic tasks may significantly vary in dynamic environments, which demand robots to be endowed with adaptation capabilities. This can be achieved through learning methods that allow the robot not only to model a manipulation task but also to adapt to unseen situations. In this context, this paper proposes a learning-from-demonstration framework that integrates force sensing and variable impedance control to learn force-based variable stiffness skills. The proposed approach estimates full stiffness matrices from human demonstrations, which are then used along with the sensed forces to encode a probabilistic model of the task. This model is used to retrieve a time-varying stiffness profile that allows the robot to satisfactorily react to new task conditions. The proposed framework evaluates two different stiffness representations: Cholesky decomposition and a Riemannian manifold approach. We validate the proposed framework in simulation using 2D and 7D systems and a couple of real scenarios.},

  abstract = {Imitation learning techniques have been used as a way to transfer skills to robots. Among them, dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) have been widely exploited as an effective and an efficient technique to learn and reproduce complex discrete and periodic skills. While DMPs have been properly formulated for learning point-to-point movements for both translation and orientation, periodic ones are missing a formulation to learn the orientation. To address this gap, we propose a novel DMP formulation that enables encoding of periodic orientation trajectories. Within this formulation we develop two approaches: Riemannian metric-based projection approach and unit quaternion based periodic DMP. Both formulations exploit unit quaternions to represent the orientation. However, the first exploits the properties of Riemannian manifolds to work in the tangent space of the unit sphere. The second encodes directly the unit quaternion trajectory while guaranteeing the unitary norm of the generated quaternions. We validated the technical aspects of the proposed methods in simulation. Then we performed experiments on a real robot to execute daily tasks that involve periodic orientation changes (i.e., surface polishing/wiping and liquid mixing by shaking).},

  abstract = {Learning from demonstration (LfD) is considered as an efficient way to transfer skills from humans to robots. Traditionally, LfD has been used to transfer Cartesian and joint positions and forces from human demonstrations. The traditional approach works well for some robotic tasks, but for many tasks of interest it is necessary to learn skills such as orientation, impedance, and/or manipulability that have specific geometric characteristics. An effective encoding of such skills can be only achieved if the underlying geometric structure of the skill manifold is considered and the constrains arising from this structure are fulfilled during both learning and execution. However, typical learned skill models such as dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) are limited to Euclidean data and fail in correctly embedding quantities with geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel and mathematically principled framework that uses concepts from Riemannian geometry to allow DMPs to properly embed geometric constrains. The resulting DMP formulation can deal with data sampled from any Riemannian manifold including, but not limited to, unit quaternions and symmetric and positive definite matrices. The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated both on simulated data and real robot experiments. The performed evaluation demonstrates that beneficial properties of DMPs, such as convergence to a given goal and the possibility to change the goal during operation, apply also to the proposed formulation.},

  abstract = {Robots that physically interact with their surroundings, in order to accomplish some tasks or assist humans in their activities, require to exploit contact forces in a safe and proficient manner. Impedance control is considered as a prominent approach in robotics to avoid large impact forces while operating in unstructured environments. In such environments, the conditions under which the interaction occurs may significantly vary during the task execution. This demands robots to be endowed with online adaptation capabilities to cope with sudden and unexpected changes in the environment. In this context, variable impedance control arises as a powerful tool to modulate the robot's behavior in response to variations in its surroundings. In this survey, we present the state-of-the-art of approaches devoted to variable impedance control from control and learning perspectives (separately and jointly). Moreover, we propose a new taxonomy for mechanical impedance based on variability, learning, and control. The objective of this survey is to put together the concepts and efforts that have been done so far in this field, and to describe advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The survey concludes with open issues in the field and an envisioned framework that may potentially solve them.},

  abstract = {There are two main categories of force control schemes: hybrid position-force control and impedance control. However, the former does not take into account the dynamic interaction between the robot’s end effector and the environment. In contrast, impedance control includes regulation and stabilization of robot motion by creating a mathematical relationship between the interaction forces and the reference trajectories. It involves an energetic pair of a flow and an effort, instead of controlling a single position or a force. A mass-spring-damper impedance filter is generally used for safe interaction purposes. Tuning the parameters of the impedance filter is important and, if an unsuitable strategy is used, this can lead to unstable contact. Humans, however, have exceptionally effective control systems with advanced biological actuators. An individual can manipulate muscle stiffness to comply with the interaction forces. Accordingly, the parameters of the impedance filter should be time varying rather than value constant in order to match human behavior during interaction tasks. Therefore, this paper presents an overview of impedance control strategies including standard and extended control schemes. Standard controllers cover impedance and admittance architectures. Extended control schemes include admittance control with force tracking, variable impedance control, and impedance control of flexible joints. The categories of impedance control and their features and limitations are well introduced. Attention is paid to variable impedance control while considering the possible control schemes, the performance, stability, and the integration of constant compliant elements with the host robot.},

Recent results on torque, position, as well as impedance control of flexible joint robots are summarized, and the relations between the individual contributions are highlighted. It is shown that an inner torque feedback loop can be incorporated into a passivity-based analysis by interpreting torque feedback in terms of shaping of the motor inertia. This result, which implicitly was already included in earlier work on torque and position control, can also be used for the design of impedance controllers. For impedance control, furthermore, potential energy shaping is of special interest. It is shown how, based only on the motor angles, a potential function can be designed which simultaneously incorporates gravity compensation and a desired Cartesian stiffness relation for the link angles. All the presented controllers were experimentally evaluated on DLR lightweight robots and their performance and robustness shown with respect to uncertain model parameters. Experimental results with position controllers as well as an impact experiment are presented briefly, and an overview of several applications is given in which the controllers have been applied.},

  abstract = {Many tasks require the robot to enter in contact with surfaces, be it to take support, to polish or to grasp an object. It is crucial that the robot controls forces both upon making contact and while in contact. While many solutions exist to control for contact, none offer the required robustness to adapt to real-world uncertainties, such as sudden displacement of the object prior and once in contact. To adapt to such disturbances require to re-plan on the fly both the trajectory and the force. Dynamical systems (DS) offer a framework for instant re-planning of trajectories. They are however limited to control of motions. We extend this framework here to enable generating contact forces and trajectories through DS. The framework allows also to modulate the impedance so as to show rigidity to maintain contact, and compliance to ensure safe interaction with humans. We validate the approach in single and dual arm setting using KUKA LWR 4+ robotic arms. We show that the approach allows 1) to make smooth contact while applying large forces, 2) to maintain desired contact force when scanning non-linear surfaces, even when the surface is moved, and 3) to grasp and lift smoothly an object in the air, and to re-balance forces on the fly to maintain the grasp even when subjected to strong external disturbances.},

  abstract = {In many tasks such as finishing operations, achieving accurate force tracking is essential. However, uncertainties in the robot dynamics and the environment limit the force tracking accuracy. Learning a compensation model for these uncertainties to reduce the force error is an effective approach to overcome this limitation. However, this approach requires an adaptive and robust framework for motion and force generation. In this paper, we use the time-invariant Dynamical System (DS) framework for force adaptation in contact tasks. We propose to improve force tracking accuracy through online adaptation of a state-dependent force correction model encoded with Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). We evaluate our method with a KUKA LWR IV+ robotic arm. We show its efficiency to reduce the force error to a negligible amount with different target forces and robot velocities. Furthermore, we study the effect of the hyper-parameters and provide a guideline for their selection. We showcase a collaborative cleaning task with a human by integrating our method to previous works to achieve force, motion, and task adaptation at the same time. Thereby, we highlight the benefits of using adaptive force control in real-world environments where we need reactive and adaptive behaviours in response to interactions with the environment.},

We propose an alternative polynomial canonical system and an adaptive law allowing a higher degree of control over the execution time. The extended framework has a potential application in robotic manipulation tasks that involve moving objects demanding real-time control over the task execution time. The existing methods require a computationally expensive forward simulation of DMP at every time step which makes it undesirable for integration in realtime control systems. To address this deficiency, the behaviour of the canonical system has been adapted according to the changes in the desired execution time of the task performed. An alternative polynomial canonical system is proposed to provide increased real-time control on the temporal scaling of DMP system compared to the standard exponential canonical system. The developed method was evaluated on scenarios of tracking a moving target where the desired tracking time is varied in real-time. The results presented show that the extended version of DMP provide better control over the temporal scaling during the execution of the task. We have evaluated our approach on a UR5 robotic manipulator for tracking a moving object.},

Learning from demonstration is arising as a promising paradigm for transferring skills to robots. It allows to implicitly learn task constraints from observing the motion executed by a human teacher, which can enable adaptive behavior. We present a novel Gaussian-Process-based learning from demonstration approach. This probabilistic representation allows to generalize over multiple demonstrations, and encode variability along the different phases of the task. In this paper, we address how Gaussian Processes can be used to effectively learn a policy from trajectories in task space. We also present a method to efficiently adapt the policy to fulfill new requirements, and to modulate the robot behavior as a function of task variability. This approach is illustrated through a real-world application using the TIAGo robot.},

  abstract = {This article presents a method for passivating the communication channel of a symmetric position-position teleoperation architecture on the time domain. The time domain passivity control approach has recently gained appeal in the context of timedelayed teleoperation because passivity is not established as a design constraint, which often forces conservative rules, but rather as a property which the system must preserve during operation. Since passivity is a network property, the first design rule within this framework is to represent consistent and comprehensible circuit (i.e., network) representations of the mechanical teleoperation system. In particular, the energetic behavior of these networks is interesting because it allows straightforward conclusions about system stability. By means of so-called passivity observers (PO) and passivity controllers (PC) (Hannaford \& Ryu, 2001), the energetic response of a delayed communication channel is captured and modulated over time so that the network in question never becomes nonpassive. The case analyzed in this paper tackles a communication channel that conveys position data back and forth. This type of channel does not offer intuitive network representation since only flows are actually being transmitted. Although energy clearly travels from one side to the other, port power identification, as defined by the correlated pair flow and effort, is not evident. This work first investigates how this kind of channel can be represented by means of circuit networks even with the lack of physical effort being transmitted through the channel, and identifies which networks are susceptible to become nonpassive due to the channel characteristics (i.e., time delay, discretization or package loss). Once achieved, a distributed control structure is presented based on a PC series that keeps the system at the verge of passivity (and therefore stability) independent from the channel properties. The results obtained by the simulation and by experiment sustain the presented approach.},

We use linear regression in a latent space to find the model parameters from a set of demonstration examples. The learning procedure requires a relevant set of similar examples. The apprehended models encode both the typical shapes of motion and their variability towards specific boundary conditions (BC). We will show the added value of encoding both properties in a unique model and we apply this ability to common problems of error compensation and target tracking. The models allow us to describe human motion using expansion-function series (EFS), thus avoiding typical stability issues that arise in the use of differential equation models. To cope with variable scenarios, we show two specific algorithms that morph and adapt the evolution trajectory. In analogy to splines, the EFS preserve an analytical structure on which we develop the optimisation steps. In such a way, we managed to combine multiple single segments into complex motions that preserve continuity and may simultaneously optimise other criteria. In the present work, after having analysed similar tools, we present the basic model and its features. Then we develop a robust tool to gather the model from examples, and to achieve real-time trajectory adaptation. The achieved results will be analysed through an experimental analysis on data collected in a ball catching experiment.},

  abstract = {There is increasing interest in control frameworks capable of moving robots from industrial cages to unstructured environments and coexisting with humans. Despite significant improvement in some specific applications (e.g., medical robotics), there is still the need for a general control framework that improves interaction robustness and motion dynamics. Passive controllers show promising results in this direction; however, they often rely on virtual energy tanks that can guarantee passivity as long as they do not run out of energy. In this paper, a fractal attractor is proposed to implement a variable impedance controller that can retain passivity without relying on energy tanks. The controller generates a fractal attractor around the desired state using an asymptotic stable potential field, making the controller robust to discretization and numerical integration errors. The results prove that it can accurately track both trajectories and end-effector forces during interaction. Therefore, these properties make the controller ideal for applications requiring robust dynamic interaction at the end-effector.},

  abstract = {Expanding robot autonomy can deliver functional flexibility and enable fast deployment of robots in challenging and unstructured environments. In this direction, significant advances have been recently made in visual-perception driven autonomy, which is mainly due to the availability of rich sensory data-sets. However, current robots’ physical interaction autonomy levels still remain at a basic level. Towards providing a systematic approach to this problem, this paper presents a new context-aware and adaptive method that allows a robotic platform to interact with unknown environments. In particular, a multi-axes self-tuning impedance controller is introduced to regulate quasi-static parameters of the robot based on previous experience in interacting with similar environments and the real-time sensory data. The proposed method is also capable of differentiating internal and external disruptions, and responding to them accordingly and appropriately. An agricultural experiment with different deformable material is presented to validate robot interaction autonomy improvements, and the capability of the proposed methodology in detecting and responding to unexpected events (e.g., faults).},

However, to find optimal policies, most reinforcement learning algorithms explore all possible actions, which may be harmful for real-world systems. As a consequence, learning algorithms are rarely applied on safety-critical systems in the real world. In this paper, we present a learning algorithm that explicitly considers safety, defined in terms of stability guarantees. Specifically, we extend control-theoretic results on Lyapunov stability verification and show how to use statistical models of the dynamics to obtain high-performance control policies with provable stability certificates. Moreover, under additional regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior, we prove that one can effectively and safely collect data in order to learn about the dynamics and thus both improve control performance and expand the safe region of the state space. In our experiments, we show how the resulting algorithm can safely optimize a neural network policy on a simulated inverted pendulum, without the pendulum ever falling down.},

The universality of the diffeomorphism learner leads to the universal approximation of the nonlinear system's Koopman eigenfunctions.

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a method which enables a robot to learn both motion skills and stiffness profiles from humans through kinesthetic human-robot cooperation. Design Methodology Approach Admittance control is applied to allow robot-compliant behaviors when following the reference trajectories. By extending the dynamical movement primitives (DMP) model, a new concept of DMP and stiffness primitives is introduced to encode a kinesthetic demonstration as a combination of trajectories and stiffness profiles, which are subsequently transferred to the robot. Electromyographic signals are extracted from a human’s upper limbs to obtain target stiffness profiles. By monitoring vibrations of the end-effector velocities, a stability observer is developed. The virtual damping coefficient of admittance controller is adjusted accordingly to eliminate the vibrations. Findings The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated experimentally. The result shows that the robot can perform tasks in a variable stiffness mode as like the human dose in the teaching phase. Originality Value DMP has been widely used as a teaching by demonstration method to represent movements of humans and robots. The proposed method extends the DMP framework to allow a robot to learn not only motion skills but also stiffness profiles. Additionally, the authors proposed a stability observer to eliminate vibrations when the robot is disturbed by environment.},

However, they struggle to solve delicate robotic problems, especially those involving contact interactions. Though in principle a policy directly outputting joint torques should be able to learn to perform these tasks, in practice we see that it has difficulty to robustly solve the problem without any given structure in the action space. In this letter, we investigate how the choice of action space can give robust performance in presence of contact uncertainties. We propose learning a policy giving as output impedance and desired position in joint space and compare the performance of that approach to torque and position control under different contact uncertainties. Furthermore, we propose an additional reward term designed to regularize these variable impedance control policies, giving them interpretability and facilitating their transfer to real systems. We present extensive experiments in simulation of both floating and fixed-base systems in tasks involving contact uncertainties, as well as results for running the learned policies on a real system (accompanying videos can be seen here: https://youtu.be/AQuuQ-h4dBM).},

  abstract = {One of the hallmarks of the performance, versatility, and robustness of biological motor control is the ability to adapt the impedance of the overall biomechanical system to different task requirements and stochastic disturbances. A transfer of this principle to robotics is desirable, for instance to enable robots to work robustly and safely in everyday human environments. It is, however, not trivial to derive variable impedance controllers for practical high degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic tasks. In this contribution, we accomplish such variable impedance control with the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm PI2 (PolicyImprovement withPath Integrals). PI2is a model-free, sampling-based learning method derived from first principles of stochastic optimal control. The PI2algorithm requires no tuning of algorithmic parameters besides the exploration noise. The designer can thus fully focus on the cost function design to specify the task. From the viewpoint of robotics, a particular useful property of PI2is that it can scale to problems of many DOFs, so that reinforcement learning on real robotic systems becomes feasible. We sketch the PI2algorithm and its theoretical properties, and how it is applied to gain scheduling for variable impedance control. We evaluate our approach by presenting results on several simulated and real robots. We consider tasks involving accurate tracking through via points, and manipulation tasks requiring physical contact with the environment. In these tasks, the optimal strategy requires both tuning of a reference trajectory and the impedance of the end-effector. The results show that we can use path integral based reinforcement learning not only for planning but also to derive variable gain feedback controllers in realistic scenarios. Thus, the power of variable impedance control is made available to a wide variety of robotic systems and practical applications.},

  abstract = {As situations with robots working in human environments are becoming increasingly important, the aspect of safety is crucial. As a consequence, the design of human friendly robots has been intensively researched in the past years, producing both mechanical and control design advancements. In this work, a safety-aware control architecture is proposed in a scenario in which a predefined task has to be executed. At the core of its implementation, a novel dynamic energy injection protocol is introduced for energy tanks. Contrarily to their most common employment in the past, energy tanks are used to provide relevant information on energy flows used by the safety protocol, rather than to guarantee passivity of the controlled robot, which does not imply safety. The algorithm is able to detect collisions and divergence from nominal task execution by identifying unwanted energy flows, encoded in the energy tanks. A reaction strategy based on low impedance control is implemented in case of collision detection. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator successfully validate the proposed strategy.},

An active control strategy based on task-space control with variable stiffness is proposed, and combined with a safety strategy for tasks requiring humans to move in the vicinity of robots. A risk indicator for human-robot collision is defined, which modulates a repulsive force distorting the spatial and temporal characteristics of the movement according to the task constraints.

  abstract = {Dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) allow complex position trajectories to be efficiently demonstrated to a robot. In contact-rich tasks, where position trajectories alone may not be safe or robust over variation in contact geometry, DMPs have been extended to include force trajectories. However, different task phases or degrees of freedom may require the tracking of either position or force -- e.g., once contact is made, it may be more important to track the force demonstration trajectory in the contact direction. The robot impedance balances between following a position or force reference trajectory, where a high stiffness tracks position and a low stiffness tracks force. This paper proposes using DMPs to learn position and force trajectories from demonstrations, then adapting the impedance parameters online with a higher-level control policy trained by reinforcement learning. This allows one-shot demonstration of the task with DMPs, and improved robustness and performance from the impedance adaptation. The approach is validated on peg-in-hole and adhesive strip application tasks.},

Second, we employ dynamic motor primitives to learn robot movements from human demonstrations and record desired tactile signal trajectories. Then, we add tactile feedback to the control loop and apply relative entropy policy search to learn the parameters of the tactile coupling. Additionally, we show how the learning of tactile feedback can be performed more efficiently by reducing the dimensionality of the tactile information through spectral clustering and principal component analysis. Our approach is implemented on a real robot, which learns to perform a scraping task with a spatula in an altered environment.},

Power envelope approaches were then proposed to impose constraints on the variable admittance parameters inferred from human intention for maintaining passivity conservatively. Our passivity preserving approaches were validated via simulation and shown to avoid mismatching of time-varying admittance parameters that restrain drastic changes of admittance controller dynamics, which usually result in instability.

In this paper, we provide an easy-to-follow structure and implementation of a robot avatar for portrait drawing by artists through remote manipulation. The proposed telerobotic system uses a digital tablet and motion capture suit as input devices, which provides accurate drawing and continuous motion data stream respectively. With sensor fusion of the input data on the robot side, the drawing process presented in this work uses a unified force and impedance controller to ensure smooth and uniform pen-strokes. The proposed scheme was used to synthesise a system that was used by an artist to successfully finish the portrait drawing of Elon Musk.

Then based on Lyapunov Stability Theorem, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to iteratively refine the previously learned differential model and SEDS is derived.

Therefore, it is extremely significant to develop a method to control the velocity and duration of the robot movement. In this paper, we define a nonlinear function based on the distance between the robot and the target to adjust the velocity of the robot.

  abstract = {In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, besides optimizing the main objective function, an agent must concurrently avoid violating a number of constraints. In particular, besides optimizing performance it is crucial to guarantee the safety of an agent during training as well as deployment (e.g. a robot should avoid taking actions - exploratory or not - which irrevocably harm its hardware). To incorporate safety in RL, we derive algorithms under the framework of constrained Markov decision problems (CMDPs), an extension of the standard Markov decision problems (MDPs) augmented with constraints on expected cumulative costs. Our approach hinges on a novel \textbackslash emph\{Lyapunov\} method. We define and present a method for constructing Lyapunov functions, which provide an effective way to guarantee the global safety of a behavior policy during training via a set of local, linear constraints. Leveraging these theoretical underpinnings, we show how to use the Lyapunov approach to systematically transform dynamic programming (DP) and RL algorithms into their safe counterparts. To illustrate their effectiveness, we evaluate these algorithms in several CMDP planning and decision-making tasks on a safety benchmark domain. Our results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing baselines in balancing constraint satisfaction and performance.},

We suggest a methodology for learning the manifold of task and DMP parameters, which facilitates runtime adaptation to changes in task requirements while ensuring predictable and robust performance. For efficient learning, the parameter space is analyzed using principal component analysis and locally linear embedding. Two manifold learning methods: kernel estimation and deep neural networks, are investigated for a ball throwing task in simulation and in a physical environment. Low runtime estimation errors are obtained for both learning methods, with an advantage to kernel estimation when data sets are small.},

ProMPs are typically initialized from human demonstrations and achieve task generalization through probabilistic operations. However, there is currently no principled guidance in the literature to determine how many demonstrations a teacher should provide and what constitutes a “good” demonstration for promoting generalization. In this paper, we present an active learning approach to learning a library of ProMPs capable of task generalization over a given space. We utilize uncertainty sampling techniques to generate a task instance for which a teacher should provide a demonstration. The provided demonstration is incorporated into an existing ProMP if possible, or a new ProMP is created from the demonstration if it is determined that it is too dissimilar from existing demonstrations. We provide a qualitative comparison between common active learning metrics; motivated by this comparison we present a novel uncertainty sampling approach named “Greatest Mahalanobis Distance.” We perform grasping experiments on a real KUKA robot and show our novel active learning measure achieves better task generalization with fewer demonstrations than a random sampling over the space.},

We propose an energy tank approach, based on the theory of stochastic port–Hamiltonian systems and weak passivity, where the energy dissipated by the stochastic system, if any, is stored into the tank to implement the desired actions. As we consider a non–vanishing noise, we need to consider weaker notion of passivity and convergence. We will show how the notion of weak passivity can be properly defined so that equipping a stochastic system with a suitable energy tank, variable admittance control can be efficiently implemented. We prove that the overall system is weakly passive and it converges toward an invariant measure. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the derived theoretical framework.},

However, many methods in IL are not guaranteed to produce stable policies. The generated policy may not converge to the robot target, reducing reliability, and may collide with its environment, reducing the safety of the system. Stable Estimator of Dynamic Systems (SEDS) produces stable policies by constraining the Lyapunov stability criteria during learning, but the Lyapunov candidate function had to be manually selected. In this work, we propose a novel method for learning a Lyapunov function and a policy using a single neural network model. The method can be equipped with an obstacle avoidance module for convex object pairs to guarantee no collisions. We demonstrated our method is capable of finding policies in several simulation environments and transfer to a real-world scenario.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a novel and safe control design approach that takes demonstrations provided by a human teacher to enable a robot to accomplish complex manipulation scenarios in dynamic environments. First, an overall task is divided into multiple simpler subtasks that are more appropriate for learning and control objectives. Then, by collecting human demonstrations, the subtasks that require robot movement are modeled by probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs). We also study two strategies for modifying the ProMPs to avoid collisions with environmental obstacles. Finally, we introduce a rule-base control technique by utilizing a finite-state machine along with a unique means of control design for ProMPs. For the ProMP controller, we propose control barrier and Lyapunov functions to guide the system along a trajectory within the distribution defined by a ProMP while guaranteeing that the system state never leaves more than a desired distance from the distribution mean. This allows for better performance on nonlinear systems and offers solid stability and known bounds on the system state. A series of simulations and experimental studies demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and show that it can run in real time. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the need to create a teach-by-demonstration framework that captures the strengths of movement primitives and verifiable, safe control. We provide a framework that learns safe control laws from a probability distribution of robot trajectories through the use of advanced nonlinear control that incorporates safety constraints. Typically, such distributions are stochastic, making it difficult to offer any guarantees on safe operation. Our approach ensures that the distribution of allowed robot trajectories is within an envelope of safety and allows for robust operation of a robot. Furthermore, using our framework various probability distributions can be combined to represent complex scenarios in the environment. It will benefit practitioners by making it substantially easier to test and deploy accurate, efficient, and safe robots in complex real-world scenarios. The approach is currently limited to scenarios involving static obstacles, with dynamic obstacle avoidance an avenue of future effort.},

The method maintains safety by ensuring that the system state stays within the region of attraction (ROA) of a stabilizing control policy while collecting data. A quadratic programming based exploration control policy is computed to keep the exploration trajectory inside an inner-approximation of the ROA and to maximize the information gained from the trajectory. A prior GP model, which incorporates prior information about the unknown dynamics, is used to construct an initial stabilizing policy. As the GP model is updated with data, it is used to synthesize a new policy and a larger ROA, which increases the range of safe exploration. The use of polynomial kernels allows us to compute ROA inner-approximations and stabilizing control laws for the model using sum-of-squares programming. We also provide a probabilistic guarantee of safety which ensures that the policy computed using the learned model stabilizes the true dynamics with high confidence.},

The major problem is that the control task hierarchy is established at the expense of the passivity of the system, which causes problems in terms of stability, robustness, and safety. Here, we extend this classical approach and passivate the closed-loop system by means of an energy tank, which is filled by the dissipated power of the active damping on both hierarchy levels. We validate the method in simulations and experiments on a torque-controlled manipulator. The concept is predestined for physical human-robot interaction and safety-relevant applications, where passivity must be guaranteed.},

The most frequently used method is to apply null space projections to realize such a strict hierarchy, where lower priority tasks are executed as long as they do not interfere with any higher priority objectives. However, introducing null space projectors inevitably destroys the beneficial and safety-relevant feature of passivity. Here, two controllers are proposed to restore the passivity: one with local energy tanks on each hierarchy level and one with a global tank for the entire system. The formal proofs of passivity show that no energy is generated by these controllers. Once the tanks are empty, passivity is still guaranteed at the cost of some control performance. Simulations and experiments on a torque-controlled robot validate the approaches and predestine them for the usage in safety-relevant applications.},

This paper presents an impedance controller with adaptive stiffness and damping terms for environmental interactive system with unknown modeling error and external disturbance. The objective is to compensate the uncertainty and disturbance and form a desired close-loop impedance architecture. A disturbance observer for nonlinear system is employed to estimate the lumped uncertainty and disturbance. The stiffness and damping are adjusted by the state-variable-related negative power type parameters. Consequently, the control input is designed with the consideration of the estimation of lumped uncertainty and disturbance as well as the regulated stiffness and damping. The stability is proved and the criterion of parameter selection is pointed out. Although the state-variable-related stiffness and damping parameters will intuitively be singular, the system works without any singularity due to the independence of these parameters in stability analysis. To verify the proposed approach, a one degree of freedom mass system is adopted and numerical simulation is performed accordingly.

The proposed variable impedance control assists the robot to perform given interaction tasks with its unknown environment and improves the overall robot- environment system performance. The stiffness, damping, and inertia can be changed during interaction tasks, which results in configuration-dependent impedance dynamics. The uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) is used to approximate the plant model with only partial information known. The prominent feature of the UDE-based control is that only the bandwidth information of the unknown plant model is needed for the control design. A stability condition for selecting the stiffness, damping, and inertia in the impedance model is provided to guarantee the stability of the control system.

  abstract = {Collaborative robots are increasingly widely used in our lives, and at the same time, the skill learning ability of robots is becoming more and more important. For this reason, a robot skill learning framework based on compliant movement primitives is proposed in this paper. The framework consists of four modules: kinesthetic teaching, task learning, compliant movement primitive library, and task generalization. Specifically, the trajectories are collected from the kinematics of the robot, and the stiffness profiles are collected from the designed variable stiffness interface based on stiffness optimization; then the collected data is optimized, segmented, and learned to create the robot's compliant movement primitive library; the primitives in the library are adjusted and combined to generate the robot's desired trajectory and desired stiffness, which are then input into the dynamics-based variable impedance controller; thereafter the controller drives the robot to perform the desired compliant motion and complete various tasks. The framework covers the entire process of robot skill learning and application, and the proposed compliant movement primitives can simultaneously achieve the robot's trajectory learning and interactive compliance learning. The experiment of the robot learning to press buttons was carried out on a universal 6-DOF collaborative robot. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and safety of the framework and show its application value.},

  abstract = {Soft robotic manipulators are continuum robots made of soft materials and flexible components. The goal of soft robotic manipulators research is to enable these manipulators to adapt their shapes to cluttered environments and to have safer interactions with human. However, there is still a problem with effectively using soft robotic manipulators in practical applications. The challenges of soft robotic manipulators in terms of materials and structure design, stiffness control, perception, and function control remain to be overcome. Here, an overview of recent advances in this field is presented, covering device architectures, actuation, variable stiffness, and sensing. Actuator technologies are discussed and roughly divided into three categories: a) tendon-driven actuation, b) fluidic actuation, and c) stimuli-responsive actuation, which is based on smart materials. Considering the working principle of stiffness variation technologies, stiffness variation technologies can be divided into two categories: a) using the interactions between structural elements, b) direct material rigidity tuning strategies. A briefly review of soft sensing technologies is presented. From the functional perspective, sensor technologies are divide into two categories: proprioception and exteroception. A conception for designing soft robotic manipulators is proposed from the perspective of soft robotic manipulator applications. Finally, the challenges this field faces are discussed.},

  abstract = {The traditional constant impedance control is a simple but effective method widely used in many fields including contact force tracking. Using this method, the location of the environment relative to the robot and the stiffness of the environment must be known, and usually the desired force is constant. However, for applications in dynamic contact force tracking in uncertain environment, it is not an effective solution. In this paper, a new adaptive variable impedance control is proposed for force tracking which has the capability to track the dynamic desired force and compensate for uncertainties (in terms of unknown geometrical and mechanical properties) in environment. In this study, the contact force model of robot end-effector and the environment is analyzed. Specifically, the contact force is used as the feedback force of a position-based impedance controller to actively track the dynamic desired force in uncertain environment. To adapt any environment stiffness uncertainties, a modified impedance control is proposed. To reduce the force tracking error caused by environment location uncertainty, an adaptive variable impedance control is implemented for the first time by adjusting the impedance parameters on-line based on the tracking error to compensate the unknown environment and the dynamic desired force. Furthermore, stability and convergence of the adaptive variable impedance control are demonstrated for a stable force tracking execution. Simulations and experiments to compare the performance of force tracking with the constant impedance control and the adaptive variable impedance control, perspectively, are conducted. The results strongly prove that the proposed approach can achieve better force tracking performance than the constant impedance control.},

In this paper, we address the accuracy-stability-speed issues simultaneously. We present a learning method named the fast and stable modeling for dynamical systems, which is based on the extreme learning machine to efficiently and accurately learn the parameters of the DS as well as to ensure the asymptotic stability at the target. We confirm the proposed approach by performing both 2-D tasks of learning handwriting motions and a set of robot experiments.},

Frequently endowing the compliant manipulation skills to the robot by manual programming or off-line training is complicated and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a sequential learning framework to take both kinematic profile and variable impedance parameter profile into consideration to model a unified control strategy with “motion generation” and “compliant control”. In order to acquire this unification controller efficiently, we use a sequential learning neural network to encode robot motion and a new force-based variable impedance learning algorithm to estimate varying damping and stiffness profiles in three directions. Furthermore, the state-independent stability constraints for variable impedance control are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed learning framework is validated by a set of experiments using the 4-DoF Barrett WAM.},

From the control standpoint, it is possible to increase this level of safety by guaranteeing that the robot will never exhibit any unstable behaviour. However, stability is not the only concern in the design of a controller for such a robot. During human-robot interaction, the resulting cooperative motion should be truly intuitive and should not restrict in any way the human performance. For this purpose, we have designed a new variable admittance control law that guarantees the stability of the robot during constrained motion and also provides a very intuitive human interaction. The first characteristic is provided by the design of a stability observer while the other is based on a variable admittance control scheme that uses the force derivative as a way to predict human intention. The stability observer is based on a previous stability investigation of cooperative motion which implies the knowledge of the interaction stiffness. A method to accurately estimate this stiffness online using the data coming from the encoder and from a multi-axis force sensor at the end effector is also provided. The stability and intuitivity of the control law were verified in a user study during a cooperative drawing task with a 3 degree-of-freedom (dof) parallel robot.},

Locally generated demonstrations of reaching motion, given by a human teacher are generally encoded in a dynamical model. Stability of this encoding system demands great attention while learning the model parameters. In that context, we present a new architecture of dynamical system to learn movement primitives from multiple demonstrations exploiting a fuzzy Lyapunov function (FLF). We assume that there exists a natural Lyapunov function (LF) that associates the demonstrations. The proposed FLF tries to approximate that LF. First, the dynamics of the demonstrations are encoded in a regressive model, learnt using Gaussian mixture regression with EM algorithm. Then the FLF is searched involving the learnt dynamics in an optimization process. The FLF in turn helps to learn a fuzzy controller. Our architecture is new in a sense that it combines the probabilistic model with a fuzzy controller to create a globally asymptotically stable motion model. The proposed algorithm can simultaneously learn position and orientation profiles in a single model. The algorithm is experimentally validated on a commercially available manipulator and also compared with a state-of-the-art technique.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the motor skill learning from human demonstrations using the framework of dynamic regressive models (DRMs). The DRM-based motion planner is preferred as it generates the end-effector trajectory dynamically based on the current state of the end-effector. Within existing frameworks, a single DRM can learn a single motion profile. In addition, such learned DRMs from the data may not be stable. This paper addresses both these issues in a comprehensive manner. In this paper a single DRM has been used to encode human demonstrations involving multitask profiles and multiple task-equilibriums which is novel. We have introduced the idea that the learned DRM will generate human-like stable motion if the energy dissipation rate (EDR) of the generated trajectory follows that of the human demonstration. Thus, the DRM structure has been modified by adding a continuous guiding signal which can be called as the control signal. This signal has been derived using control theoretic principle to ensure asymptotic stability while maintaining the EDR equivalent to that of the human demonstration. The asymptotic stability of the learned DRM has been established by involving a nonmonotonic Lyapunov function consisting of first derivative of a quadratic function and the energy function associated with the DRM. The proposed framework can be learned using many existing regression techniques in this paper Gaussian mixture regression, locally weighted projection regression, and support vector regression techniques have been used successfully. During the pick and place tasks, human demonstrations involving multiple task profiles and multiple task-equilibriums are generated using a 7 DOF commercial robot manipulator. Experimental validations show that the DRMs learned using these three regression schemes are able to guide the robot along the multitask profiles in a stable manner.},

The control scheme is developed by experimenting with an air-paint-brush. The painting process emulates the actual welding. Such an emulating environment is useful to surmount the difficulties of experimentation with actual welding. The impedance parameters of the control scheme are investigated. A damping value is determined for an effective vibration suppression and minimum human effort. A variable impedance control scheme is applied to ease the manipulation of the torch while not welding. The results of real welding of novice welders with and without robot assistance are presented.

The impedance compensation does not assume a preprogrammed hand trajectory. Rather, the intention of the human for the hand movement is estimated in real time using a smooth Kalman filter. The movement is restricted by compensatory virtual impedance in the directions perpendicular to the estimated direction of movement. With airbrush painting experiments, we test three sets of values for the impedance parameters as inspired from impedance measurements with manual welding. We apply the best of the tested sets for assistance in manual welding and perform welding experiments with professional and novice welders. We contrast three conditions: 1) welding with the robot's assistance; 2) with the robot when the robot is passive; and 3) welding without the robot. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the assistance through quantitative measures of both task performance and perceived user's satisfaction. The performance of both the novice and professional welders improves significantly with robotic assistance compared to welding with a passive robot. The assessment of user satisfaction shows that all novice and most professional welders appreciate the robotic assistance as it suppresses the tremors in the directions perpendicular to the movement for welding.},

  abstract = {There is a substantial number of telerobotics and teleoperation applications ranging from space operations, ground/aerial robotics, drive-by-wire systems to medical interventions. Major obstacles for such applications include latency, channel corruptions, and bandwidth which limit teleoperation efficacy. This survey reviews the time delay problem in teleoperation systems. We briefly review different solutions from early approaches which consist of control-theory-based models and user interface designs and focus on newer approaches developed since 2014. Future solutions to the time delay problem will likely be hybrid solutions which include modeling of user intent, prediction of robot movements, and time delay prediction all potentially using time series prediction methods. Hence, we examine methods that are primarily based on time series prediction. Recent prediction approaches take advantage of advances in nonlinear statistical models as well as machine learning and neural network techniques. We review Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Sequence to Sequence, and Generative Adversarial Network models and examine each of these approaches for addressing time delay. As time delay is still an unsolved problem, we suggest some possible future research directions from information-theory-based modeling, which may lead to promising new approaches to advancing the field.},

  abstract = {Introducing some form of autonomy in robotic surgery is being considered by the medical community to better exploit the potential of robots in the operating room. However, significant technological steps have to occur before even the smallest autonomous task is ready to be presented to the regulatory authorities. In this paper, we address the initial steps of this process, in particular the development of control concepts satisfying the basic safety requirements of robotic surgery, i.e., providing the robot with the necessary dexterity and a stable and smooth behavior of the surgical tool. Two specific situations are considered: the automatic adaptation to changing tissue stiffness and the transition from autonomous to teleoperated mode. These situations replicate real-life cases when the surgeon adapts the stiffness of her/his arm to penetrate tissues of different consistency and when, due to an unexpected event, the surgeon has to take over the control of the surgical robot. To address the first case, we propose a passivity-based interactive control architecture that allows us to implement stable time-varying interactive behaviors. For the second case, we present a two-layered bilateral control architecture that ensures a stable behavior during the transition between autonomy and teleoperation and, after the switch, limits the effect of initial mismatch between master and slave poses. The proposed solutions are validated in the realistic surgical scenario developed within the EU-funded I-SUR project, using a surgical robot prototype specifically designed for the autonomous execution of surgical tasks like the insertion of needles into the human body.},

  abstract = {Dynamical Systems (DS) are fundamental to the modeling and understanding time evolving phenomena, and have application in physics, biology and control. As determining an analytical description of the dynamics is often difficult, data-driven approaches are preferred for identifying and controlling nonlinear DS with multiple equilibrium points. Identification of such DS has been treated largely as a supervised learning problem. Instead, we focus on an unsupervised learning scenario where we know neither the number nor the type of dynamics. We propose a Graph-based spectral clustering method that takes advantage of a velocity-augmented kernel to connect data points belonging to the same dynamics, while preserving the natural temporal evolution. We study the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Graph Laplacian and show that they form a set of orthogonal embedding spaces, one for each sub-dynamics. We prove that there always exist a set of 2-dimensional embedding spaces in which the sub-dynamics are linear and n-dimensional embedding spaces where they are quasi-linear. We compare the clustering performance of our algorithm to Kernel K-Means, Spectral Clustering and Gaussian Mixtures and show that, even when these algorithms are provided with the correct number of sub-dynamics, they fail to cluster them correctly. We learn a diffeomorphism from the Laplacian embedding space to the original space and show that the Laplacian embedding leads to good reconstruction accuracy and a faster training time through an exponential decaying loss compared to the state-of-the-art diffeomorphism-based approaches.},

The objective of the work is to enhance the performance during human-robot physical interaction by combining Cartesian impedance modulation and redundancy resolution. Cartesian impedance control is employed to achieve a compliant behavior of the robot's end effector in response to forces exerted by the human operator. Different impedance modulation strategies, which take into account the human's behavior during the interaction, are selected with the support of a simulation study and then experimentally tested on a 7-degree-of-freedom KUKA LWR4. A comparative study to establish the most effective redundancy resolution strategy has been made by evaluating different solutions compatible with the considered task. The experiments have shown that the redundancy, when used to ensure a decoupled apparent inertia at the end effector, allows enlarging the stability region in the impedance parameters space and improving the performance. On the other hand, the variable impedance with a suitable modulation strategy for parameters' tuning outperforms the constant impedance, in the sense that it enhances the comfort perceived by humans during manual guidance and allows reaching a favorable compromise between accuracy and execution time.},

In this formulation, a model of the joint space trajectory is represented as a sequence of motion primitives where a nonlinear dynamical system is learned by constructing a hidden Markov model (HMM) predicting the probability of residing in each motion primitive. With a coordinated mixture of factor analyzers as the emission probability density of the HMM, we are able to synthesize motion from a dynamic system acting along a manifold shared by both demonstrator and robot. This provides significant advantages in model complexity for kinematically redundant robots and can reduce the number of corresponding observations required for further learning. A stability analysis shows that the system is robust to deviations from the expected trajectory as well as transitional motion between manifolds. This approach is demonstrated experimentally by recording human motion with inertial sensors, learning a motion primitive model and correspondence map between the human and robot, and synthesizing motion from the manifold to control a 19 degree-of-freedom humanoid robot.},

  abstract = {State-dependent dynamical systems (DSs) offer adaptivity, reactivity, and robustness to perturbations in motion planning and physical human?robot interaction tasks. Learning DS-based motion plans from non-linear reference trajectories is an active research area in robotics. Most approaches focus on learning DSs that can (i) accurately mimic the demonstrated motion, while (ii) ensuring convergence to the target, i.e., they are globally asymptotically (or exponentially) stable. When subject to perturbations, a compliant robot guided with a DS will continue following the next integral curves of the DS towards the target. If the task requires the robot to track a specific reference trajectory, this approach will fail. To alleviate this shortcoming, we propose the locally active globally stable DS (LAGS-DS), a novel DS formulation that provides both global convergence and stiffness-like symmetric attraction behaviors around a reference trajectory in regions of the state space where trajectory tracking is important. This allows for a unified approach towards motion and impedance encoding in a single DS-based motion model, i.e., stiffness is embedded in the DS. To learn LAGS-DS from demonstrations we propose a learning strategy based on Bayesian non-parametric Gaussian mixture models, Gaussian processes, and a sequence of constrained optimization problems that ensure estimation of stable DS parameters via Lyapunov theory. We experimentally validated LAGS-DS on writing tasks with a KUKA LWR 4+ arm and on navigation and co-manipulation tasks with iCub humanoid robots.},

The hierarchical top layer is used to implement a strategy that addresses the desired transparency, and the lower layer ensures that no “virtual” energy is generated. This means that any bilateral controller can be implemented in a passive manner. Separate communication channels connect the layers at the slave and master sides so that information related to exchanged energy is completely separated from information about the desired behavior. Furthermore, the proposed implementation does not depend on any type of assumption about the time delay in the communication channel. By complete separation of the properties of passivity and transparency, each layer can accommodate any number of different implementations that allow for almost independent optimization. Experimental results are presented, which highlight the benefit of the proposed framework.},

We show the advantages of this approach when obstacles have known shape, and we extend it to unknown objects using minimal enclosing ellipsoids. A simulation and experiments with a real robot validate the framework, and we make freely available our implementation.},

  abstract = {Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) is a framework for learning a point-to-point trajectory from a demonstration. Despite being widely used, DMPs still present some shortcomings that may limit their usage in real robotic applications. Firstly, at the state of the art, mainly Gaussian basis functions have been used to perform function approximation. Secondly, the adaptation of the trajectory generated by the DMP heavily depends on the choice of hyperparameters and the new desired goal position. Lastly, DMPs are a framework for ‘one-shot learning’, meaning that they are constrained to learn from a unique demonstration. In this work, we present and motivate a new set of basis functions to be used in the learning process, showing their ability to accurately approximate functions while having both analytical and numerical advantages w.r.t. Gaussian basis functions. Then, we show how to use the invariance of DMPs w.r.t. affine transformations to make the generalization of the trajectory robust against both the choice of hyperparameters and new goal position, performing both synthetic tests and experiments with real robots to show this increased robustness. Finally, we propose an algorithm to extract a common behavior from multiple observations, validating it both on a synthetic dataset and on a dataset obtained by performing a task on a real robot.},

However, most state-of-the-art learning-based nonlinear trajectory tracking controllers still lack any formal guarantees. In this letter, we exploit the property of differential flatness to design an online, robust learning-based controller to achieve both high tracking performance and probabilistically guarantee a uniform ultimate bound on the tracking error. A common control approach for differentially flat systems is to try to linearize the system by using a feedback (FB) linearization controller designed based on a nominal system model. Performance and safety are limited by the mismatch between the nominal model and the actual system. Our proposed approach uses a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) to both improve FB linearization and quantify, probabilistically, the uncertainty in our FB linearization. We use this probabilistic bound in a robust linear quadratic regulator (LQR) framework. Through simulation, we highlight that our proposed approach significantly outperforms alternative learning-based strategies that use differential flatness.},

The methodology requires a single demonstration and can deduce a stable dynamics in arbitrary high dimensions. The method relies on the idea that there exists a latent space in which the nonlinear dynamics appears quasi linear. The original nonlinear dynamics is mapped into a stable linear DS, by leveraging on the properties of graph embeddings. We show that the eigendecomposition of the Graph Laplacian results in linear embeddings in two dimensions and quasi-linear in higher dimensions. The nonlinear terms vanish, exponentially as the number of datapoints increase, and for large density of points, the embedding appears linear. We show that this new embedding enables to model highly nonlinear dynamics in high dimension and overcomes alternative techniques in both precision of reconstruction and number of parameters required for the embedding. We demonstrate its applicability to control real robot tasked to perform complex free motion in space.},

In order to enable robots to share their workspace with humans and physically interact with them, fast and reliable handling of possible collisions on the entire robot structure is needed, along with control strategies for safe robot reaction. The primary motivation is the prevention or limitation of possible human injury due to physical contacts. In this survey paper, based on our early work on the subject, we review, extend, compare, and evaluate experimentally model-based algorithms for real-time collision detection, isolation, and identification that use only proprioceptive sensors. This covers the context-independent phases of the collision event pipeline for robots interacting with the environment, as in physical human-robot interaction or manipulation tasks. The problem is addressed for rigid robots first and then extended to the presence of joint/transmission flexibility. The basic physically motivated solution has already been applied to numerous robotic systems worldwide, ranging from manipulators and humanoids to flying robots, and even to commercial products.},

In the proposed method, a systematic online adaptation mechanism using the wavelet neural network is presented to adapt the impedance parameter according to a variable environment. Using the introduced adaptive law, the robot would be able to track the desired force on the moving environment with the unknown stiffness. Unlike the general impedance control which the position and stiffness of the environment need to be available and known for choosing the impedance parameters, the proposed structure for the impedance equation leads to adapt the impedance parameters according to the interaction environment. In addition, the stability conditions and adaptation laws using Lyapunov’s method for the variable impedance are given to guarantee the force tracking and stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, various numerical and experimental results verify the performance of the proposed adaptive approach. The experimental results strongly prove that the presented method has a better force tracking performance than the general impedance with constant parameters.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its integration with deep learning have achieved impressive performance in various robotic control tasks, ranging from motion planning and navigation to end-to-end visual manipulation. However, stability is not guaranteed in model-free RL by solely using data. From a control-theoretic perspective, stability is the most important property for any control system, since it is closely related to safety, robustness, and reliability of robotic systems. In this letter, we propose an actor-critic RL framework for control which can guarantee closed-loop stability by employing the classic Lyapunov's method in control theory. First of all, a data-based stability theorem is proposed for stochastic nonlinear systems modeled by Markov decision process. Then we show that the stability condition could be exploited as the critic in the actor-critic RL to learn a controller/policy. At last, the effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on several well-known 3-dimensional robot control tasks and a synthetic biology gene network tracking task in three different popular physics simulation platforms. As an empirical evaluation on the advantage of stability, we show that the learned policies can enable the systems to recover to the equilibrium or way-points when interfered by uncertainties such as system parametric variations and external disturbances to a certain extent.},

However, in some special cases, original discrete DMP fails to generalize proper trajectories. Moreover, it is difficult to produce trajectories on the curved surface. To solve the above problems, a modified DMP method is proposed for robot control by adding the scaling factor and force coupling term. First, the adjusted cosine similarity is defined to assess the similarity of the generalized trajectory with respect to the demonstrated trajectory. By optimizing the similarity, the trajectories can be generated in all situations. Next, by adding the force coupling term derived from adaptive admittance control to the transformation system of the original DMP, the controller achieves the force control ability. Then, the modified DMP-based robot control system is developed. The stability and convergence of the system are proved. Finally, the high precisions of the proposed method are verified by simulations and experiments. The method is significant for trajectory learning and generalization on the curved surface.},

  abstract = {Manipulation requires contact with the object being manipulated, and the full potential of robots can only be realized when they are applied to contact tasks. One of the difficulties engendered by contact tasks is that they require intimate dynamic interaction between the robot and its environment. That interaction changes the performance of the robot and can jeopardize the stability of its control system. A discussion is presented of the problem of preserving the stability of a manipulator's control system during contact tasks. It will be shown that contact stability may be guaranteed if the control system provides the manipulator with an appropriately structured dynamic response to environmental inputs. Two aspects of one implementation of such a controller will be considered. Robustness to large errors in the manipulator kinematic equations and to unmodeled interface dynamics is shown.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly used for single peg-in-hole assembly, where assembly skill is learned through interaction with the assembly environment in a manner similar to skills employed by human beings. However, the existing RL algorithms are difficult to apply to the multiple peg-in-hole assembly because the much more complicated assembly environment requires sufficient exploration, resulting in a long training time and less data efficiency. To this end, this article focuses on how to predict the assembly environment and how to use the predicted environment in assembly action control to improve the data efficiency of the RL algorithm. Specifically, first, the assembly environment is exactly predicted by a variable time-scale prediction (VTSP) defined as general value functions (GVFs), reducing the unnecessary exploration. Second, we propose a fuzzy logic-driven variable time-scale prediction-based reinforcement learning (FLDVTSP-RL) for assembly action control to improve the efficiency of the RL algorithm, in which the predicted environment is mapped to the impedance parameter in the proposed impedance action space by a fuzzy logic system (FLS) as the action baseline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VTSP and the data efficiency of the FLDVTSP-RL methods, a dual peg-in-hole assembly experiment is set up; the results show that FLDVTSP-deep Q-learning (DQN) decreases the assembly time about 44\% compared with DQN and FLDVTSP-deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) decreases the assembly time about 24\% compared with DDPG. Note to Practitioners—The complicated assembly environment of the multiple peg-in-hole assembly results in a contact state that cannot be recognized exactly from the force sensor. Therefore, contact-model-based methods that require tuning of the control parameters based on the contact state recognition cannot be applied directly in this complicated environment. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) methods without contact state recognition have recently attracted scientific interest. However, the existing RL methods still rely on numerous explorations and a long training time, which cannot be directly applied to real-world tasks. This article takes inspiration from the manner in which human beings can learn assembly skills with a few trials, which relies on the variable time-scale predictions (VTSPs) of the environment and the optimized assembly action control strategy. Our proposed fuzzy logic-driven variable time-scale prediction-based reinforcement learning (FLDVTSP-RL) can be implemented in two steps. First, the assembly environment is predicted by the VTSP defined as general value functions (GVFs). Second, assembly action control is realized in an impedance action space with a baseline defined by the impedance parameter mapped from the predicted environment by the fuzzy logic system (FLS). Finally, a dual peg-in-hole assembly experiment is conducted; compared with deep Q-learning (DQN), FLDVTSP-DQN can decrease the assembly time about 44\%; compared with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), FLDVTSP-DDPG can decrease the assembly time about 24\%.},

  abstract = {Imitation learning has been studied widely as a convenient way to transfer human skills to robots. This learning approach is aimed at extracting relevant motion patterns from human demonstrations and subsequently applying these patterns to different situations. Despite the many advancements that have been achieved, solutions for coping with unpredicted situations (e.g., obstacles and external perturbations) and high-dimensional inputs are still largely absent. In this paper, we propose a novel kernelized movement primitive (KMP), which allows the robot to adapt the learned motor skills and fulfill a variety of additional constraints arising over the course of a task. Specifically, KMP is capable of learning trajectories associated with high-dimensional inputs owing to the kernel treatment, which in turn renders a model with fewer open parameters in contrast to methods that rely on basis functions. Moreover, we extend our approach by exploiting local trajectory representations in different coordinate systems that describe the task at hand, endowing KMP with reliable extrapolation capabilities in broader domains. We apply KMP to the learning of time-driven trajectories as a special case, where a compact parametric representation describing a trajectory and its first-order derivative is utilized. In order to verify the effectiveness of our method, several examples of trajectory modulations and extrapolations associated with time inputs, as well as trajectory adaptations with high-dimensional inputs are provided.},

In this paper, we propose a learning control-based hierarchical control strategy to adapt to new goal positions and avoid obstacles: the high-level learning scheme is targeted at imitating the motor skill and generating the optimization trajectory for obstacle avoidance; the lowerlevel control scheme focuses on the safety and stability of the robot’s movement with unknown disturbances. Firstly, the enhanced DMPs framework is presented to imitate the trajectory from human demonstrations, where the novel DMPs can adapt to new goal position with the changing goal, and avoid single or multiple obstacles. Then, the fuzzy adaptive control method is employed to control redundant manipulators, where the fuzzy logic system (FLS) is incorporated to approximate an unknown nonlinear function term of the unknown disturbance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed learning-control strategy is demonstrated with simulation results.

One area in which soft robotics has the ability to make significant impact is in the development of soft grippers and manipulators. With an increased requirement for automation, robotics systems are required to perform task in unstructured and not well defined environments; conditions which conventional rigid robotics are not best suited. This requires a paradigm shift in the methods and materials used to develop robots such that they can adapt to and work safely in human environments. One solution to this is soft robotics, which enables soft interactions with the surroundings while maintaining the ability to apply significant force. This review paper assesses the current materials and methods, actuation methods and sensors which are used in the development of soft manipulators. The achievements and shortcomings of recent technology in these key areas are evaluated, and this paper concludes with a discussion on the potential impacts of soft manipulators on industry and society.},

In order to improve the robustness and adaptability of imitation learning, a hierarchical learning strategy is proposed: low-level learning comprises only behavioral cloning with supervised learning, and high-level learning constitutes policy improvement. First, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based dynamical system is formulated to encode a motion from the demonstration. We then derive the sufficient conditions of the GMM parameters that guarantee the global stability of the dynamical system from any initial state, using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Generally, imitation learning should reason about the motion well into the future for a wide range of tasks; it is significant to improve the adaptability of the learning method by policy improvement. Finally, a method based on exponential natural evolution strategies is proposed to optimize the parameters of the dynamical system associated with the stiffness of variable impedance control, in which the exploration noise is subject to stability conditions of the dynamical system in the exploration space, thus guaranteeing the global stability. Empirical evaluations are conducted on manipulators for different scenarios, including motion planning with obstacle avoidance and stiffness learning.},

  abstract = {Imitation learning techniques aim to mimic human behavior in a given task. An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems have been used in many disciplines to model complex behaviors, including biological motor control, robotics, perception, economics, traffic prediction, and neuroscience. While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.},

The resultant movement plan remains an autonomous set of nonlinear differential equations that forms a control policy (CP) which is robust to strong external perturbations and that can be modified on-line by additional perceptual variables. We evaluate the system with a humanoid robot simulation and an actual humanoid robot. Experiments are presented for the imitation of three types of movements: reaching movements with one arm, drawing movements of 2-D patterns, and tennis swings. Our results demonstrate (a) that multi-joint human movements can be encoded successfully by the CPs, (b) that a learned movement policy can readily be reused to produce robust trajectories towards different targets, (c) that a policy fitted for one particular target provides a good predictor of human reaching movements towards neighboring targets, and (d) that the parameter space which encodes a policy is suitable for measuring to which extent two trajectories are qualitatively similar.},

Our approach consists of two steps, a learning step that uses Gaussian processes and a controller synthesis step that is based on control barrier functions. In the learning step, we use a data-driven approach utilizing Gaussian processes to learn the unknown control affine nonlinear dynamics together with a statistical bound on the accuracy of the learned model. In the second controller synthesis steps, we develop a systematic approach to compute control barrier functions that explicitly take into consideration the uncertainty of the learned model. The control barrier function not only results in a safe controller by construction but also provides a rigorous lower bound on the probability of satisfaction of the safety specification. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results by synthesizing a safety controller for a jet engine example.},

In order to enhance subject's cooperation during training sessions, the robot should allow deviation in the prescribed path depending on the subject's modified limb motions subsequent to the disability. In the present work, an interactive training paradigm based on the impedance control was developed for a lightweight intrinsically compliant parallel ankle rehabilitation robot. The parallel ankle robot is powered by pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs). The proposed training paradigm allows the patients to modify the robot imposed motions according to their own level of disability. The parallel robot was operated in four training modes namely position control, zero-impedance control, nonzero-impedance control with high compliance, and nonzero-impedance control with low compliance to evaluate the performance of proposed control scheme. The impedance control scheme was evaluated on 10 neurologically intact subjects. The experimental results show that an increase in robotic compliance encouraged subjects to participate more actively in the training process. This work advances the current state of the art in the compliant actuation of parallel ankle rehabilitation robots in the context of interactive training.},

Firstly, an original optimal variable law is designed via demonstration learning, through which the Gaussian mixture model/Gaussian mixture regression (GMM/GMR) algorithm is employed to transfer the human impedance functions to the robot. By using the formulation of the GMR result, the regression task can be completed without using the ground-truth information of the human impedance parameters. To ensure the stability, a minimal complementary input is designed for the learned second-order impedance system. We transform the design problem to a constrained convex optimization problem, of which the constraints are related to a Lyapunov function. A criterion for choosing the Lyapunov functions is presented to ensure the feasibility of the problem, and an analytical solution is computed. The proposed approach is verified by the robotic-assisted rehabilitation and trajectory reproduction experiments conducted on a 7-DOF Franka Panda robot.},

The robot is actuated using optimal joint-space velocity control input to track a time-varying end-effector trajectory in its task space. In comparison to the existing near-optimal kinematic control solutions for robot manipulator under AC framework, proposed controller exhibits guaranteed analytical stability.

However, most of the existing works do not address the issue of control stability. This is in sharp contrast to the control theory community where the well-established norm is to prove stability whenever a control law is synthesized. What makes traditional stability analysis difficult for DRL are the uninterpretable nature of the neural network policies and unknown system dynamics. In this work, stability is obtained by deriving an interpretable deep policy structure based on the energy shaping control of Lagrangian systems. Then, stability during physical interaction with an unknown environment is established based on passivity. The result is a stability guaranteeing DRL in a model-free framework that is general enough for contact-rich manipulation tasks. With an experiment on a peg-in-hole task, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first DRL with stability guarantee on a real robotic manipulator.},

One of the most important properties that is of interest is control stability. Ideally, one would like to achieve stability guarantees while staying within the framework of state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms. Such a solution does not exist in general, especially one that scales to complex manipulation tasks. We contribute towards closing this gap by introducing normalizing-flow control structure, that can be deployed in any latest deep RL algorithms. While stable exploration is not guaranteed, our method is designed to ultimately produce deterministic controllers with provable stability. In addition to demonstrating our method on challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks, we also show that it is possible to achieve considerable exploration efficiency–reduced state space coverage and actuation efforts– without losing learning efficiency.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has had its fair share of success in contact-rich manipulation tasks but it still lags behind in benefiting from advances in robot control theory such as impedance control and stability guarantees. Recently, the concept of variable impedance control (VIC) was adopted into RL with encouraging results. However, the more important issue of stability remains unaddressed. To clarify the challenge in stable RL, we introduce the term all-the-time-stability that unambiguously means that every possible rollout will be stability certified. Our contribution is a model-free RL method that not only adopts VIC but also achieves all-the-time-stability. Building on a recently proposed stable VIC controller as the policy parameterization, we introduce a novel policy search algorithm that is inspired by Cross-Entropy Method and inherently guarantees stability. Our experimental studies confirm the feasibility and usefulness of stability guarantee and also features, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful application of RL with all-the-time-stability on the benchmark problem of peg-in-hole.},

  abstract = {Learning to effectively imitate human teleoperators, with generalization to unseen and dynamic environments, is a promising path to greater autonomy enabling robots to steadily acquire complex skills from supervision. We propose a new motion learning technique rooted in contraction theory and sum-of-squares programming for estimating a control law in the form of a polynomial vector field from a given set of demonstrations. Notably, this vector field is provably optimal for the problem of minimizing imitation loss while providing continuous-time guarantees on the induced imitation behavior. Our method generalizes to new initial and goal poses of the robot and can adapt in real-time to dynamic obstacles during execution, with convergence to teleoperator behavior within a well-defined safety tube. We present an application of our framework for pick-and-place tasks in the presence of moving obstacles on a 7-DOF KUKA IIWA arm. The method compares favorably to other learning-from-demonstration approaches on benchmark handwriting imitation tasks.},

  abstract = {We consider an imitation learning approach to model robot point-to-point (also known as discrete or reaching) movements with a set of autonomous Dynamical Systems (DS). Each DS model codes a behavior (such as reaching for a cup and swinging a golf club) at the kinematic level. An estimate of these DS models are usually obtained from a set of demonstrations of the task. When modeling robot discrete motions with DS, ensuring stability of the learned DS is a key requirement to provide a useful policy. In this paper we propose an imitation learning approach that exploits the power of Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) control scheme to ensure global asymptotic stability of nonlinear DS. Given a set of demonstrations of a task, our approach proceeds in three steps: (1) Learning a valid Lyapunov function from the demonstrations by solving a constrained optimization problem, (2) Using one of the-state-of-the-art regression techniques to model an (unstable) estimate of the motion from the demonstrations, and (3) Using (1) to ensure stability of (2) during the task execution via solving a constrained convex optimization problem. The proposed approach allows learning a larger set of robot motions compared to existing methods that are based on quadratic Lyapunov functions. Additionally, by using the CLF formalism, the problem of ensuring stability of DS motions becomes independent from the choice of regression method. Hence it allows the user to adopt the most appropriate technique based on the requirements of the task at hand without compromising stability. We evaluate our approach both in simulation and on the 7 degrees of freedom Barrett WAM arm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We formulate this control policy by a non-parametric potential function and a dissipative field, which both can be learned from human demonstrations. We show that the robot motion and its stiffness behaviors can be encapsulated by the potential function's gradient and curvature, respectively. The dissipative field can also be used to model desired damping behavior throughout the motion, hence generating motions that follows the same velocity profile as the demonstrations. The proposed controller can be realized as a unification approach between "realtime motion generation" and "variable impedance control", with the advantages that it has guaranteed stability as well as does not rely on following a reference trajectory. Our approach, called unified motion and variable impedance control (UMIC), is completely time-invariant and can be learned from a few demonstrations via solving two (convex) constrained quadratic optimization problems. We validate UMIC on a library of 30 human handwriting motions and on a set of experiments on 7-DoF KUKA light weight robot.},

  abstract = {Successful execution of many robotic tasks requires precise control of robot motion and its interaction with the environment. In robotics these two problems are mainly studied separately in the domain of robot motion generation and interaction control, respectively. Existing approaches rely on two control loops: a motion generator (planner) that provides a reference trajectory in the outer loop, and an active impedance controller that tracks the reference trajectory in the inner loop. Ensuring stability of the closed-loop system for this control architecture is nontrivial. In this paper, we propose a single-loop control architecture that performs motion generation and interaction control at once. We model robot discrete motions with a time-invariant dynamical system, which is expressed as a nonlinear combination of a set of linear spring-damper systems. This formulation represents the nominal motion and the impedance properties with a single set of parameters, simplifying stability analysis of the closed-loop system. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure global asymptotic stability of this system for movements in free-space, and its passivity during persistent contact with a passive environment. We validate our approach in simulation using the 7-DoF KUKA LWR-IV robot.},

The goal of this work is to provide (1) a unified robotic architecture to produce these two roles, and (2) a human-guidance detection algorithm to switch across the two roles. In the absence of human-guidance, the robot performs its task autonomously and upon detection of such guidances the robot passively follows the human motions. We employ dynamical systems to generate task-specific motion and admittance control to generate reactive motions toward the human-guidance. This structure enables the robot to reject undesirable perturbations, track the motions precisely, react to human-guidance by providing proper compliant behavior, and re-plan the motion reactively. We provide analytical investigation of our method in terms of tracking and compliant behavior. Finally, we evaluate our method experimentally using a 6-DoF manipulator.},

However, to date there have been only few extensions which have incorporated perceptual coupling to variables of external focus, and, furthermore, these modifications have relied upon handcrafted solutions. Humans learn how to couple their movement primitives with external variables. Clearly, such a solution is needed in robotics. In this paper, we propose an augmented version of the dynamic systems motor primitives which incorporates perceptual coupling to an external variable. The resulting perceptually driven motor primitives include the previous primitives as a special case and can inherit some of their interesting properties. We show that these motor primitives can perform complex tasks such a Ball-in-a-Cup or Kendama task even with large variances in the initial conditions where a skilled human player would be challenged. For doing so, we initialize the motor primitives in the traditional way by imitation learning without perceptual coupling. Subsequently, we improve the motor primitives using a novel reinforcement learning method which is particularly well-suited for motor primitives.},

  abstract = {Hitting and batting tasks, such as tennis forehands, ping-pong strokes, or baseball batting, depend on predictions where the ball can be intercepted and how it can properly be returned to the opponent. These predictions get more accurate over time, hence the behaviors need to be continuously modified. As a result, movement templates with a learned global shape need to be adapted during the execution so that the racket reaches a target position and velocity that will return the ball over to the other side of the net or court. It requires altering learned movements to hit a varying target with the necessary velocity at a specific instant in time. Such a task cannot be incorporated straightforwardly in most movement representations suitable for learning. For example, the standard formulation of the dynamical system based motor primitives (introduced by Ijspeert et al. [1]) does not satisfy this property despite their flexibility which has allowed learning tasks ranging from locomotion to kendama. In order to fulfill this requirement, we reformulate the Ijspeert framework to incorporate the possibility of specifying a desired hitting point and a desired hitting velocity while maintaining all advantages of the original formulation. We show that the proposed movement template formulation works well in two scenarios, i.e., for hitting a ball on a string with a table tennis racket at a specified velocity and for returning balls launched by a ball gun successfully over the net using forehand movements. All experiments were carried out on a Barrett WAM using a four camera vision system.},

Second, impedance learning is introduced to regulate the control input in order to improve the environment-robot interaction, and the robot can track the desired trajectory generated by impedance learning. Third, in light of the condition requiring the robot to move in a finite space or to move at a limited velocity in a finite space, the algorithm based on the position constraint and the velocity constraint are proposed, respectively. To guarantee the position constraint and the velocity constraint, an integral barrier Lyapunov function is introduced to avoid the violation of the constraint. According to Lyapunov's stability theory, it can be proved that the tracking errors are uniformly bounded ultimately.

Despite first approaches exist in this direction, no fully integrated approach has been proposed so far. In this paper, we introduce a new class of admittance-coupled DMPs that addresses environmental changes by including contact wrench feedback dynamics into the DMP formalism. Moreover, a novel iterative learning approach is devised that is based on monitoring the overall system passivity analysis in terms of reference power tracking. Simulations and experimental results with the Kuka LWR robot maintaining a non-rigid contact with the environment (wiping a surface) are shown for supporting the validity of our approach.},

The last decade has seen substantial growth in research on the problem of robot manipulation, which aims to exploit the increasing availability of affordable robot arms and grippers to create robots capable of directly interacting with the world to achieve their goals. Learning will be central to such autonomous systems, as the real world contains too much variation for a robot to expect to have an accurate model of its environment, the objects in it, or the skills required to manipulate them, in advance. We aim to survey a representative subset of that research which uses machine learning for manipulation.

Task execution of DS models is typically done in an open-loop manner in combination with standard low level controller, e.g. position controller or impedance controller. Such an arrangement has two important drawbacks: 1) it is not passive and 2) the DS model cannot respond to physical perturbations on the robot body. These can imply severe consequences in motion tasks involving expected or unexpected contact with objects whose position is unknown and dynamic. We propose a novel control architecture that closes the loop around the DS, ensures passivity and allows intuitive tuning of the robot impedance.

In fact, the standard stability analysis is not valid in the case that the impedance parameters vary over time. Simulations show that, depending on how the impedance parameters are varied, stable or unstable behavior can arise even in regulation without contact. In this paper, we elucidate this issue and propose a state-independent stability constraint that relates the stiffness, and also the time derivative of the stiffness to the damping.

Starting point of this work is an earlier paper where the authors learn a non-linear dynamic robot movement model from a small number of observations. The model in that work is learned using a classical finite Gaussian mixture model (FGMM) where the Gaussian mixtures are appropriately constrained. The problem with this approach is that one needs to make a good guess for how many mixtures the FGMM should use. In this work, we generalize this approach to use an infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) which does not have this limitation. Instead, the IGMM automatically finds the number of mixtures that are necessary to reflect the data complexity. For use in the context of a non-linear dynamic model, we develop a Constrained IGMM (CIGMM). We validate our algorithm on the same data that was used in [5], where the authors use motion capture devices to record the demonstrations. As further validation we test our approach on novel data acquired on our iCub in a different demonstration scenario in which the robot is physically driven by the human demonstrator.},

In this letter, we propose an active learning method for contextual ProMPs for addressing this problem. More specifically, we learn the trajectory distributions using a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (BGMM) and then leverage the notion of epistemic uncertainties to iteratively choose new context query points for demonstrations. We show that this approach reduces the required number of human demonstrations.

The implementation of safety measures in pHRI applications typically depends strongly on coordinates, e.g., to monitor the robot velocity or to predict external forces. We show that the current certification process does not, in general, guarantee a safe robot behavior. In particular, in unstructured environments it is not possible to predict all risks in advance. We therefore propose to control the energy of the robot, which is a coordinate invariant entity. For an impedance controlled robot, the total energy consists of potential energy and kinetic energy. The energy flow from task description to physical interaction follows a strict causality. We assign a safe energy budget for the robot. With this energy budget, the presented controller auto-tunes its parameters to limit the exchanged kinetic energy during a collision and the potential energy during clamping scenarios. In contact, the robot behaves compliantly and therefore eliminates clamping danger. After contact, the robot automatically continues to follow the desired trajectory. With this approach the number of safety-related parameters to be determined can be reduced to one energy value, which has the potential to significantly speed up the commissioning of pHRI applications. The proposed technique is validated by experiments.},

  abstract = {Usability is one of the most important aspects of teleoperation. Ideally, the operator’s experience should be one of complete command over the remote environment, but also be as close as possible to what they would have if physically present at the remote end, i.e., transparency in terms of both action and perception. These two aspects may coincide in favorable conditions, where classic approaches such as the four-channel architecture ensures transparency of the control framework. In the presence of substantial delays between the user and the slave, however, the stability–performance trade-off inherent to bilateral teleoperation deteriorates not only transparency, but also command. An alternative, unilateral approach is given by tele-impedance, which controls the slave–environment interaction by measuring and remotely replicating the user’s limb endpoint position and impedance. Not including force feedback to the operator, tele-impedance is absolutely robust to delays, whereas it completely lacks transparency. This article introduces a novel control framework that integrates a new, fully transparent, two-channel bilateral architecture with the tele-impedance paradigm. The result is a unified solution that mitigates problems of classical approaches, and provides the user with additional tools to modulate the slave robot’s physical interaction behavior, resulting in a better operator experience in spite of time inconsistencies. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated in terms of performance in the interaction tasks, of user fatigue and overall experience.},

  abstract = {The safe operation of physical systems typically relies on high-quality models. Since a continuous stream of data is generated during run-time, such models are often obtained through the application of Gaussian process regression because it provides guarantees on the prediction error. Due to its high computational complexity, Gaussian process regression must be used offline on batches of data, which prevents applications, where a fast adaptation through online learning is necessary to ensure safety. In order to overcome this issue, we propose the LoG-GP. It achieves a logarithmic update and prediction complexity in the number of training points through the aggregation of locally active Gaussian process models. Under weak assumptions on the aggregation scheme, it inherits safety guarantees from exact Gaussian process regression. These theoretical advantages are exemplarily exploited in the design of a safe and data-efficient, online-learning control policy. The efficiency and performance of the proposed real-time learning approach is demonstrated in a comparison to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel force tracking impedance control strategy is presented in which target stiffness is varied on-line to regulate the desired contact force without any knowledge of the environment. Humans can control contact force by adjusting their arm stiffness. The contact force can be either increased by making one's arm stiffer or decreased by reducing the arm stiffness. Furthermore, humans can keep the force tracking error within a certain range without any knowledge of environmental parameters as long as how much force they exert on the object is known to them. Analogously, the proposed control scheme achieves a contact force regulation control by adjusting the target stiffness of the impedance control. The new force tracking impedance control scheme does not require estimating environment stiffness or locations since the controller is adapted only based on the previous force tracking error between the desired and real contact force. Stability of the proposed scheme is discussed with a quadratic Lyapunov function. Extensive simulation studies with a 7 degree of freedom (DoF) robot manipulator using full arm dynamics are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme.},

The PSPM modulates the original set-position signal in such a way that the modulated signal is as close to the original signal as possible (i.e., maximum information recovery for better performance), yet only to the extent permissible by the available energy in the system (i.e., passivity constraints). We present its algorithm and theoretically show its passivity and performance. We also show how this PSPM can be applied for two applications, with some experimental results: Internet teleoperation with varying delay and packet loss; and haptics with slow and variable-rate data update.},

  abstract = {Unpredictable and time-variable adhesion force between the rubber unstacking robot and the rubber block is generated, which makes it difficult for the robot to smoothly complete the rubber disassembly task, thereby bringing about new robot control problems. For solving the above problems, a novel method of inner/outer loop impedance control based on natural gradient actor-critic (NAC) reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper. The required impedance is applied by the inner/outer loop impedance control with time delay estimation, which can correct the modeling error and compensate the nonlinear dynamics term to improve the computational efficiency of the system. In addition, the NAC reinforcement learning algorithm based on recursive least squares filtering is used to optimize the impedance parameters online, which can improve the impedance accuracy and robustness in the unstructured dynamic environment. At the same time, three stability constraints of the control strategy are derived in the analysis process. Finally, by setting up the experimental platform, it is verified that the control strategy can make the robot work smoothly under the action of unpredictable and time-variable adhesion force to reduce vibration and improve rubber unstacking performance.},

This article develops a Riemannian-based dynamic movement primitive (DMP) framework for learning and generalizing multispace data, including position, orientation, and stiffness from human demonstration. A simplified geometric configuration of the human arm skeleton is adopted to extract its endpoint stiffness. The dynamic skills of a variable stiffness are obtained in real time and then transferred to robots. The effectiveness of the presented approach is verified by two experiments in real scenarios on the Franka Emika Panda robot. The experimental results indicate that both kinematic and dynamic skills can be learned and generalized by the extended DMP framework with high accuracy and strong correlation. The human-like variable impedance control of a robot can be successfully realized by using the proposed approach. Thus, the proposed approach, including the stiffness estimation model and the skill learning and generalization framework, is suitable for applications of human–robot collaboration, contact operation, and teleoperation, where the position, orientation, and stiffness need to be considered simultaneously.},

Classical DMPs framework mainly focuses on the movement learning in Cartesian or joint space, and can't properly represent end-effector orientation. In this paper, we present an extended DMPs framework (EDMPs) both in Cartesian space and 2-Dimensional (2D) sphere manifold for Quaternion-based orientation learning and generalization. Gaussian mixture model and Gaussian mixture regression (GMM-GMR) are adopted as the initialization phase of EDMPs to handle multi-demonstrations and obtain their mean and covariance. Additionally, some evaluation indicators including reachability and similarity are defined to characterize the learning and generalization abilities of EDMPs. Finally, a real-world experiment was conducted with human demonstrations, the endpoint poses of human arm were recorded and successfully transferred from human to the robot. The experimental results show that the absolute errors of the Cartesian and Riemannian space skills are less than 3.5 mm and 1.0°, respectively. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients of the Cartesian and Riemannian space skills are mostly greater than 0.9. The developed EDMPs exhibits superior reachability and similarity for the multi-space skills’ learning and generalization. This research proposes a fused framework with EDMPs and GMM-GMR which has sufficient capability to handle the multi-space skills in multi-demonstrations.},

However, current methods typically require too many interactions to achieve good performance. Data-inefficiency has limited these methods to learn force-sensitive tasks in real systems. In order to improve the sampling efficiency and decrease the required interactions during the learning process, this paper develops a data-efficient learning variable impedance control method that enables the industrial robots automatically learn to control the contact force in the unstructured environment. To this end, a Gaussian process model is learned as a faithful proxy of the system, which is then used to predict long-term state evolution for internal simulation, allowing for efficient strategy updates. The effects of model bias are reduced effectively by incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning. Then the impedance profiles are regulated online according to the learned humanlike impedance strategy. In this way, the flexibility and adaptivity of the system could be enhanced. Both simulated and experimental tests have been performed on an industrial manipulator to verify the performance of the proposed method.},

Motivated by the human versatility, we develop here a robot controller that concurrently adapts feedforward force, impedance, and reference trajectory when interacting with an unknown environment. In particular, the robot's reference trajectory is adapted to limit the interaction force and maintain it at a desired level, while feedforward force and impedance adaptation compensates for the interaction with the environment. An analysis of the interaction dynamics using Lyapunov theory yields the conditions for convergence of the closed-loop interaction mediated by this controller. Simulations exhibit adaptive properties similar to human motor adaptation. The implementation of this controller for typical interaction tasks including drilling, cutting, and haptic exploration shows that this controller can outperform conventional controllers in contact tooling.},

The problem of inferring objectives from observations has received extensive theoretical and methodological development from both the controls and machine learning communities. In this paper, we provide an integrating view of objective learning from human demonstration data. We differentiate algorithms based on the assumptions made about the objective function structure, how the similarity between the inferred objectives and the observed demonstrations is assessed, the assumptions made about the agent and environment model, and the properties of the observed human demonstrations. We review the application domains and validation approaches of existing works and identify the key open challenges and limitations.

  abstract = {Impedance control is an effective force tracking approach for robot contact operation tasks such as grinding/polishing, deburring, assembly and dexterous hand manipulations, etc. Within the impedance control framework, when the robot begins to contact with the environment, however, force oscillations may occur even if the optimal approach velocity is adopted, which may increase the settling time of the system, result in serious damage to the parts, and even make the otherwise stable controller unstable. To this end, based on the real-time adjustment of the desired force by the nonlinear tracking differentiator (NTD) strategy, a novel force oscillations reduction method for robot contact tasks is proposed in this article, which can reduce the force oscillations in a feed-forward style. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the NTD is used to reduce the force oscillations. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulations and experiments, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the force oscillations, which provides a simple and useful solution for practical robot contact applications.},

  abstract = {With the developments of intelligent and autonomous robotic technology, robots are usually designed to confront sophisticated tasks such as automated assembly, which requires both high-speed positioning capabilities and compliance with unknown contact environments. As we know, a high-performance motion tracking control in free space can achieve efficient and accurate positioning, while impedance or force control shows superior performance in terms of sensitive force and compliance with unknown contact environments. However, it is still challenging to achieve both high-performance motion tracking and compliance within one single control framework, especially in unknown contact environments. To this end, in this article, a unified motion/force/impedance approach for unknown contact environments is proposed by robust model-reaching control with dynamic trajectory adaptation. Specifically, the overall control scheme includes two loops: the outer loop replans the trajectories of motion and force in real time to meet the environmental constraints, which are estimated by the recursive least squares estimation law; in the inner loop, the robust model-reaching control law is proposed to realize a target model, which is designed to establish a dynamic relationship between the motion and force tracking errors of the replanned trajectories. Then, by changing the matrices of the target model, the compromise between motion tracking and force tracking can be achieved, as well as different control objectives. Experiments are conducted on a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator to validate the advantages of the proposed scheme.},

The force sensor is normally mounted with an instrument on the end-effector to measure the human operational force. However, when the robot is in contact with the human and an environment simultaneously, the force sensor reading includes both the human and the environmental force resulting in ineffective contacting interaction within these three objects (robot, human and environment). In addition, if the environment is moving, it is more challenging for the operator to track the target with the robot. Therefore, in this paper, we address the issue of pHRI coupled with a moving environment. More specifically, we use a collaborative robot with an ultrasound probe as an illustration due to its sophisticated condition: the operator needs to contact the environment using a sufficient force to get clearer images and track the moving target. The proposed control scheme is employed using only one force sensor to guarantee a stable physical interaction within three objects and provide the compliant and intuitive operation for human. Experiments with a collaborative robot are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

In this context, both intentional and accidental contacts between human and robot might occur due to the complexity of tasks and environment, to the uncertainty of human behavior, and to the typical lack of awareness of each other actions. Here, a two stage strategy based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is designed to detect intentional and accidental contacts: the occurrence of a contact with the human is detected at the first stage, while the classification between intentional and accidental is performed at the second stage. An admittance control strategy or an evasive action is then performed by the robot, respectively. The approach also works in the case the robot simultaneously interacts with the human and the environment, where the interaction wrench of the latter is modeled via Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are included, at the control level, to guarantee the satisfaction of robot and task constraints while performing the proper interaction strategy. The approach has been validated on a real setup composed of a Kinova Jaco2 robot.},

  abstract = {Movement Primitives (MPs) are a well-known concept to represent and generate modular trajectories. MPs can be broadly categorized into two types: (a) dynamics-based approaches that generate smooth trajectories from any initial state, e. g., Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), and (b) probabilistic approaches that capture higher-order statistics of the motion, e. g., Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs). To date, however, there is no method that unifies both, i. e. that can generate smooth trajectories from an arbitrary initial state while capturing higher-order statistics. In this paper, we introduce a unified perspective of both approaches by solving the ODE underlying the DMPs. We convert expensive online numerical integration of DMPs into basis functions that can be computed offline. These basis functions can be used to represent trajectories or trajectory distributions similar to ProMPs while maintaining all the properties of dynamical systems. Since we inherit the properties of both methodologies, we call our proposed model Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMPs). Additionally, we embed ProDMPs in deep neural network architecture and propose a new cost function for efficient end-to-end learning of higher-order trajectory statistics. To this end, we leverage Bayesian Aggregation for non-linear iterative conditioning on sensory inputs. Our proposed model achieves smooth trajectory generation, goal-attractor convergence, correlation analysis, non-linear conditioning, and online re-planing in one framework.},

This paper describes a reinforcement learning (RL) strategy for manipulation and grasping of a mobile manipulator, which reduces the complexity of the visual feedback and handle varying manipulation dynamics and uncertain external perturbations. Two hierarchies plannings have been considered in the proposed strategy: 1) high-level online redundancy resolution based on the neural-dynamic optimization algorithm in operational space; and 2) low-level RL in joint space. At this level, the dynamic movement primitives have been considered to model and learn the joint trajectories, and then the RL is employed to learn the trajectories with uncertainties. Experimental results on the developed humanoidlike mobile robot demonstrate that the presented approach can suppress the uncertain external perturbations.},

For this reason, the purpose of this research is to form an excellent force controller by considering the transient contact force response, overshoot and steady-state force-tracking accuracy. Design/methodology/approach Combining the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) and the adaptive fuzzy PD controller, an enhanced admittance force-tracking controller framework and a well-designed control scheme are proposed. Tracking differentiator balances the contradiction between inertia and jump control signal of the control object. Kalman filter and extended state observer are introduced to obtain purer feedback force signal and uncertainty compensation. Adaptive fuzzy PD controller is introduced to account for transient and steady state performance of the system. Findings The proposed controller has achieved successful results through simulation and actual test of 6-axis robot with minimum error. Practical implications The controller is simple and practical in real industrial scenarios, where force control by robots is required. Originality/value In this research, a new practical force control algorithm is proposed to guarantee the performance of the force controller for robots interacting with high dynamic environments.},

However, the unstable supporting force directly leads to vibration and even deformation of thin-walled parts, so maintaining an ideal supporting force is essential to raise the processing quality of thin-walled parts. In this paper, an adaptive variable impedance control with Fuzzy-PI compound controller designed for the supporting element is presented, which has the ability to resolve the force tracking problem under unknown environments. The method combines the fast response of Fuzzy control with the steady-state error suppression of PI control and can quickly and stably track the ideal force. In this study, the defects of the traditional constant impedance control in an unknown environment are firstly pointed out, and then an adaptive variable impedance control method using a Fuzzy-PI compound controller to adjust the target damping online is proposed to compensate for force tracking errors caused by the unknown environment based on these defects. In addition, the stability and convergence of the proposed method in the force tracking process are demonstrated. The simulation and experimental results show that, compared to the traditional constant impedance control, the force tracking performance of the proposed control method is significantly improved in terms of response speed and steady-state accuracy.},

This paper takes inspiration in human eye-arm-hand coordination pattern to develop an equivalently robust robot controller. We recorded gaze, arm, hand, and trunk data from human subjects in reaching and grasping scenarios with/without obstacle in the workspace. An eye-arm-hand controller is developed, based on our extension of Coupled Dynamical Systems (CDS). We exploit the time-invariant properties of the CDS to allow fast adaptation to spatial and temporal perturbations during task completion. CDS global stability guarantees that the eye, the arm and the hand will reach the target in retinal, operational and grasp space respectively. When facing perturbations, the system can re-plan its actions almost instantly, without the need for an additional planning module. Coupling profiles for eye-arm and arm-hand systems can be modulated allowing to adjust the behavior of each slave system with respect to control signals flowing from the corresponding master system. We show how the CDS eye-arm-hand control framework can be used to handle the presence of obstacles in the workspace. The eye-arm-hand controller is validated in a series of experiments conducted with the iCub robot.},

  abstract = {Precise robotic manipulation skills are desirable in many industrial settings, reinforcement learning (RL) methods hold the promise of acquiring these skills autonomously. In this paper, we explicitly consider incorporating operational space force/torque information into reinforcement learning; this is motivated by humans heuristically mapping perceived forces to control actions, which results in completing high-precision tasks in a fairly easy manner. Our approach combines RL with force/torque information by incorporating a proper operational space force controller; where we also exploit different ablations on processing this information. Moreover, we propose a neural network architecture that generalizes to reasonable variations of the environment. We evaluate our method on the open-source Siemens Robot Learning Challenge, which requires precise and delicate force-controlled behavior to assemble a tight-fit gear wheel set.},

Based on the hybrid control idea, the task space is decoupled into two subspaces of position and force.

Despite the predictive power of these systems, it has been difficult to make formal claims about the basic properties of the learned systems. In this paper, we propose an approach for learning dynamical systems that are guaranteed to be stable over the entire state space. The approach works by jointly learning a dynamics model and Lyapunov function that guarantees non-expansiveness of the dynamics under the learned Lyapunov function. We show that such learning systems are able to model simple dynamical systems and can be combined with additional deep generative models to learn complex dynamics, such as video textures, in a fully end-to-end fashion.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) of contact-rich manipulation tasks has yielded impressive results in recent years. While many studies in RL focus on varying the observation space or reward model, few efforts focused on the choice of action space (e.g. joint or end-effector space, position, velocity, etc.). However, studies in robot motion control indicate that choosing an action space that conforms to the characteristics of the task can simplify exploration and improve robustness to disturbances. This paper studies the effect of different action spaces in deep RL and advocates for Variable Impedance Control in End-effector Space (VICES) as an advantageous action space for constrained and contact-rich tasks. We evaluate multiple action spaces on three prototypical manipulation tasks: Path Following (task with no contact), Door Opening (task with kinematic constraints), and Surface Wiping (task with continuous contact). We show that VICES improves sample efficiency, maintains low energy consumption, and ensures safety across all three experimental setups. Further, RL policies learned with VICES can transfer across different robot models in simulation, and from simulation to real for the same robot.

  abstract = {Learning from demonstration has shown to be a suitable approach for learning control policies (CPs). However, most previous studies learn CPs from a single demonstration, which results in limited scalability and insufficient generalization toward a wide range of applications in real environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to learn highly scalable CPs of basis movement skills from multiple demonstrations. In contrast to conventional studies with a single demonstration, i.e., dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), our approach efficiently encodes multiple demonstrations by shaping a parametric-attractor landscape in a set of differential equations. Assuming a certain similarity among multiple demonstrations, our approach learns the parametric-attractor landscape by extracting a small number of common factors in multiple demonstrations. The learned CPs allow the synthesis of novel movements with novel motion styles by specifying the linear coefficients of the bases as parameter vectors without losing useful properties of the DMPs, such as stability and robustness against perturbations. For both discrete and rhythmic movement skills, we present a unified learning procedure for learning a parametric-attractor landscape from multiple demonstrations. The feasibility and highly extended scalability of DMPs are demonstrated on an actual dual-arm robot.},

  abstract = {The problem of acquiring multiple tasks from demonstration is typically divided in two sequential processes: (1) the segmentation or identification of different subgoals/subtasks and (2) a separate learning process that parameterizes a control policy for each subtask. As a result, segmentation criteria typically neglect the characteristics of control policies and rely instead on simplified models. This paper aims for a single model capable of learning sequences of complex time-independent control policies that provide robust and stable behavior. To this end, we first present a novel and efficient approach to learn goal-oriented time-independent motion models by estimating~\textbackslash emphboth attractor and dynamic behavior from data guaranteeing stability using linear parameter varying~(LPV) systems.  This method enables learning complex task sequences with hidden Markov models~(HMMs), where each state/subtask is given by a stable LPV system and where transitions are most likely around the corresponding attractor. We study the dynamics of the HMM-LPV model and propose a motion generation method that guarantees the stability of task sequences. We validate our approach in two sets of demonstrated human motions.},

Besides simulation, components such as sensing, perception, data collection, robot hardware control, human interfaces, etc. are all key enablers towards applying machine learning algorithms or model-based approaches in real world systems. However, there is a lack of software connecting reliable contact simulation with the larger robotics ecosystem (i.e. ROS, Orocos), for a more seamless application of novel approaches, found in the literature, to existing robotic hardware. In this paper, we present the ROS-PyBullet Interface, a framework that provides a bridge between the reliable contact/impact simulator PyBullet and the Robot Operating System (ROS). Furthermore, we provide additional utilities for facilitating Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in the simulated environment. We also present several use-cases that highlight the capabilities and usefulness of our framework. Please check our video, source code, and examples included in the supplementary material.

  abstract = {Rehabilitative and assistive practices usually elicit intense and repetitive exercises. Thus, there has been an increasing interest in robotic systems as they are robust and cost-effective in comparison to conventional physical motor-therapy with a therapist. These robots have applications in therapeutic and in-home environments, where there is a necessity for a user-friendly procedure to program the robots for a specific task easily. Our group has suggested robot learning from demonstration (LfD) as an intuitive procedure to program robots via short-term physical interaction in rehabilitation and assistive applications. In this article, a therapist assists a patient, and cooperatively performs a task on a robotic manipulator. Then, using a nonparametric potential field function, the therapist's motion, and interaction force (assistance/resistance) is modeled time-independently via a convex optimization algorithm. Next, in the therapist's absence, the robot provides the patient with the same level of interaction force provided by the therapist along the trajectory. A velocity field controller is also designed to compensate and regulate the patient's deviation from the velocity observed in the demonstration phase. Finally, the efficacy, advantages, and stability of the proposed framework are evaluated in three different experimental scenarios involving spring arrays and an individual with cerebral palsy (CP).},

In order to solve a given task in situations that were not considered during the initial learning, it is necessary to adapt trajectories contained in the library of primitive motions to new situations. In this paper we explore how to apply reinforcement learning to modify the subgoals of primitive movements involved in the given task. As the underlying sensorimotor representation we selected nonlinear dynamic systems, which provide a powerful machinery for the modification of motion trajectories. We propose a new formulation for dynamic systems, which ensures that consecutive primitive movements can be splined together in a continuous way (up to second order derivatives).},

Several approaches yield stable dynamical systems but are also limited to specific dynamics that can potentially result in a poor reproduction performance. The current work addresses this accuracy–stability dilemma through a new diffeomorphic transformation approach that serves as a framework generalizing the class of demonstrations that are learnable by means of provably stable dynamical systems. We apply the proposed framework to extend the application domain of the stable estimator of dynamical systems (SEDS) by generalizing the class of learnable demonstrations by means of diffeomorphic transformations τ. The resulting approach is named τ-SEDS and analyzed with rigorous theoretical investigations and robot experiments.},

  abstract = {Integrated dynamic systems such as mechatronic or control systems generally contain passive elements and internal energy sources that are appropriately modulated to perform the desired dynamic actions. The overall passivity of such systems is a useful property that relates to the stability and the safety of the system, in the sense that the maximum net amount of energy that the system can impart to the environment is limited by its initial state. In this paper, conditions under which a physical system containing internal modulated sources is globally passive are investigated using bond graph modelling techniques. For the class of systems under consideration, bond graph models include power bonds and active (signals) bonds modulating embedded energy sources, so that the continuity of power (or energy conservation) in the junction structure is not satisfied. For the purpose of the analysis, a so-called bond graph pseudo-junction structure is proposed as an alternative representation for linear time-invariant (LTI) bond graph models with internal modulated sources. The pseudo-junction structure highlights the existence of a multiport coupled resistive field involving the modulation gains of the internal sources and the parameters of dissipative elements, therefore implicitly realizing the balance of internal energy generation and dissipation. Moreover, it can be regarded as consisting of an inner structure which satisfies the continuity of power, and an outer structure in which a power scaling is performed in relation with the dissipative field. The associated multiport coupled resistive field constitutive equations can then be used to determine the passivity property of the overall system. The paper focuses on systems interconnected in cascade (with no loading effect) or in closed-loop configurations which are common in control systems.},

The proposed approach leverages control barrier functions in order to ensure that the multi-robot system remains dissipative.

This constraint is then included in an optimization problem, whose objective is that of modifying, in a minimally invasive fashion, the nominal input to the robots. The formulated optimization problem is decentralized in the sense that, in order to be solved, it does not require the individual robots to have access to global information. Moreover, thanks to its convexity, each robot can solve it using fast and efficient algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is demonstrated through the implementation of a formation control algorithm in presence of delays on a team of mobile robots.},

  abstract = {Passivity-based control (PBC) is a well-established technique that has shown to be very powerful to design robust controllers for physical systems described by Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations of motion. For regulation problems of mechanical systems, which can be stabilized “shaping” only the potential energy, PBC preserves the EL structure and furthermore assigns a closed-loop energy function equal to the difference between the energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. Thus, we say that stabilization is achieved via energy balancing. Unfortunately, these nice properties of EL–PBC are lost when used in other applications which require shaping of the total energy, for instance, in electrical or electromechanical systems, or even some underactuated mechanical devices. Our main objective in this paper is to develop a new PBC theory which extends to a broader class of systems the aforementioned energy-balancing stabilization mechanism and the structure invariance. Towards this end, we depart from the EL description of the systems and consider instead port-controlled Hamiltonian models, which result from the network modelling of energy-conserving lumped-parameter physical systems with independent storage elements, and strictly contain the class of EL models.},

  abstract = {The Time Domain Passivity Control Approach (TDPA) is a powerful tool to guarantee passive interaction between a robot and its environment. Rather than establishing fixed control parameters to keep the system stable in any possible environment, the TDPA observes the energy flow due to the interaction and applies a dissipative term in the case the interaction becomes active. In a robot manipulator the rationale behind the Passivity Controller requires a criterion on how to distribute the energy to be dissipated among the multiple joints and must be adjusted according to the general control goal of the application. This paper presents a method for distributing the dissipation between decoupled subspaces of a redundant manipulator, prioritizing dissipation in the null-space. The method allows to preserve passivity while avoiding disturbance of the general control goal defined in the task-space. Thus the general control goal can, to some extent, be as well decoupled from passivity considerations and thus a less conservative controller can be achieved. The approach is sustained with a numerical simulation.},

  abstract = {With emerging capabilities, robots will advance gradually into human environments in the near future. Thereby, safety and robustness is currently tackled through intrinsically soft robotics or variable impedances, mainly stiffnesses. In tele-operation, for instance, the control stiffness can be adapted to a measured arm impedance of the operator to stiffen the robot only when required for a manipulation task. Thus, humans or moving objects in the robot’s environment are protected from hard collisions. Independent from its realization through hardware or software, the stability of the variation needs to be ensured through control strategies since energy is potentially introduced into the robotic system. This work presents a novel gradient-based passivity control concept for variable stiffnesses. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, the approach is based on a potential energy storage reference and prevents phases of zero stiffness through deflection-domain control. I.e., according to the energy storage, the stiffness variation over the spring deflection is controlled to ensure passivity. Experiments confirm the functionality of the approach and its robustness against delayed communication and active environments.},

The proposed virtual fixtures assist the user in repeating the learned kinematic behavior but allow penetration so that the user can make modifications to the learned trajectory if needed. The tracking error in combination with the interaction forces and torques is used by a variable stiffness strategy to adjust the progressive automation level and transition the leading role between the human and the robot. An energy tank approach is utilized to apply the designed controller and to prove the passivity of the overall control method.

In the paper, two sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure the input-to-state stability (ISS) irrespective of time-varying stiffness. Furthermore, the update rule of the stiffness is also suggested in such a way that the asymptotic stability is guaranteed under certain region conditions. Even when the update rule is not applied, the ISS is at least assured. In other words, the error is always bounded only if the external force/torque is bounded. In detail, two sufficient conditions offer the lower bound of stiffness and the upper bound of its time derivative. Simulation results show that the ISS of variable impedance control is achieved if the proposed sufficient conditions are satisfied. Also, we can confirm the asymptotic behavior in the simulation when the stiffness is updated according to the given rule.},

To represent an observed movement, a non-linear differential equation is learned such that it reproduces this movement. Based on this representation, we build a library of movements by labeling each recorded movement according to task and context (e.g., grasping, placing, and releasing). Our differential equation is formulated such that generalization can be achieved simply by adapting a start and a goal parameter in the equation to the desired position values of a movement. For object manipulation, we present how our framework extends to the control of gripper orientation and finger position. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated in simulation as well as on the Sarcos dextrous robot arm. The robot learned a pick-and-place operation and a water-serving task and could generalize these tasks to novel situations.},

Associating stereotypical movements to particular tasks enables our system to use previous sensor experiences as a predictive model for subsequent task executions. We use dynamical systems, named Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), to learn goal-directed behaviors from demonstration. We exploit their dynamic properties by coupling them with the measured and predicted sensor traces. This feedback loop allows for online adaptation of the movement plan. Our system can create a rich set of possible motions that account for external perturbations and perception uncertainty to generate truly robust behaviors.

  abstract = {Complex and interactive robot manipulation skills, such as playing a game of table tennis against a human opponent, are a novel problem with multifaceted challenges. Accurate dynamic trajectory generation in order to respond to the tennis ball from the opponent and a novel control scheme for robust and high-performance tracking of the ball in such dynamic situations is a prerequisite to winning the game. In this paper, the dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) are employed for the stable generation of dynamic trajectories in the presence of environmental uncertainties such as ball position and velocity, opponent position and velocity and so on. In DMP, kernels parameters need to be found from expert demonstrations using a learning technique. To mitigate environmental uncertainties by accurate reconstruction of novel dynamic trajectories by combining multiple DMPs, we propose a piecewise linear canonical system (PLCS)-based modified DMP in contrast to the standard exponential canonical system (ECS)-based DMP. To enhance effectiveness and performance, a novel learning technique based on Lyapunov stability is embedded with the above-developed formulation. We show that the proposed learning technique is faster, has the best steady state error performance, and requires almost half the kernels than the state of the art. Next, to intercept the dynamic moving ball in real-time using the DMP, a novel control scheme is needed and designed using fuzzy fractional order sliding mode control. The control scheme results in chatter free tracking of the desired trajectories because the control law is free from sgn(·) function. The tracking control performance is guaranteed theoretically via the Lyapunov approach and also verified through simulations and experiments. Finally, we have developed a complete system (including a vision system for tracking the ball) using a real 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) Barrett Wam robotic arm and show that the proposed overall framework is able to respond to a hanging ball with high accuracy.},

Consequently, in recent years, a big impulse has been given to the design of human-friendly robots by involving both mechanical and control design aspects. Regarding controller design, this often involves introducing compliance and ensuring asymptotic stability using an interaction control scheme and passivity theory. Moreover, when human operators physically interact with the robot during work, strict safety measures become necessary with some of these including power and force limitations [1]. In this letter, a novel impedance control technique for collaborative robots is presented. The featured controller allows a safe human-robot interaction through energy and power limitations, assuring passivity through energy tanks. The proposed controller is evaluated with a KUKA LWR 4+ arm in a comanipulation environment.},

In this regard, this work proposes a first approach to impedance control for robot manipulators with bounded inputs which aims to achieve safe human–robot interaction. The proposed scheme has a nonlinear proportional–derivative structure with compensation (PD\$\$+\$\$) based on the robot model, makes use of generalized saturation functions to generate bounded control actions, and includes an external torque compensation term based on the user’s electromyographic information. One of the main advantages of this proposal is that the human–robot interaction is defined in the joint space, which avoids singularities, since the robot works within its natural coordinates and the torque applied by the user is estimated at a joint level. The advantage of the novel control scheme can be demonstrated by the stability analysis of the closed-loop system equilibrium point, as well as by comparative analysis of the simulation results.},

Additional structure is imposed which guarantees smooth convergent motions to a goal location. The aforementioned structure involves viewing motions on an observed Riemannian manifold as deformations of straight lines on a latent Euclidean space. The observed and latent spaces are related through a diffeomorphism. Thus, this paper presents an approach for learning flexible diffeomorphisms, resulting in a stable dynamical system.  The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through validation on an established benchmark as well demonstrations collected on a real-world robotic system.},

The learning framework uses a demonstrator that implements a black-box, untrusted strategy presumed to solve the problem of interest, a learner that poses finitely many queries to the demonstrator to infer a candidate function, and a verifier that checks whether the current candidate is a valid control Lyapunov-like function. The overall learning framework is iterative, eliminating a set of candidates on each iteration using the counterexamples discovered by the verifier and the demonstrations over these counterexamples. We prove its convergence using ellipsoidal approximation techniques from convex optimization. We also implement this scheme using nonlinear MPC controllers to serve as demonstrators for a set of state and trajectory stabilization problems for nonlinear dynamical systems. We show how the verifier can be constructed efficiently using convex relaxations of the verification problem for polynomial systems to semi-definite programming problem instances. Our approach is able to synthesize relatively simple polynomial control Lyapunov-like functions, and in that process replace the MPC using a guaranteed and computationally less expensive controller.},

The position and the orientation (represented using quaternions) trajectories are modeled as two separate autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems. The special constraints of the \$\$\{\textbackslash mathbb \{S\}\}\^\{3\}\$\$manifold are enforced in the formulation of the system that models the orientation dynamics. To capture the variability in the demonstrations, the dynamical systems are estimated using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The parameters of the GMMs are learned subject to the constraints derived using partial contraction analysis. The learned models’ reproductions are shown to accurately reproduce the demonstrations and are guaranteed to converge to the desired goal location. Experimental results illustrate the CDSP algorithm’s ability to accurately learn position and orientation dynamics and the utility of the learned models in path generation for a Baxter robot arm. The CDSP algorithm is evaluated on a publicly available dataset and a synthetic dataset, and is shown to have the lowest and comparable average reproduction errors when compared to state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems play a crucial role in control systems because, in practice, all the plants are nonlinear, and they are also a hopeful description of complex robot movements. To perform a control and stability analysis of a nonlinear system, usually, a Lyapunov function is used. In this article, we proposed a method to compute a control Lyapunov function (CLF) for nonlinear dynamics based on a learning robust neuro-control strategy. The procedure uses a deep neural network architecture to generate control functions supported by the Lyapunov stability theory. An estimation of the region of attraction is produced for advanced stability analysis. We implemented two numerical examples to compare the performance of the proposed technique with some existing methods. The proposed method computes a CLF that provides the stabilizability of the systems and produced better solutions to nonlinear systems in the design of stable controls without linear approximations and in the presence of disturbances.},

  abstract = {An important challenge when using reinforcement learning for learning motions in robotics is the choice of parameterization for the policy. We use Gaussian Mixture Regression to extract a parameterization with relevant non-linear features from a set of demonstrations of a motion following the paradigm of learning from demonstration. The resulting parameterization takes the form of a non-linear time-invariant dynamical system (DS). We use this time-invariant DS as a parameterized policy for a variant of the PI2 policy search algorithm. This paper contributes by adapting PI2 for our time-invariant motion representation. We introduce two novel parameter exploration schemes that can be used to (1) sample model parameters to achieve a uniform exploration in state space and (2) explore while ensuring stability of the resulting motion model. Additionally, a state dependent stiffness profile is learned simultaneously to the reference trajectory and both are used together in a variable impedance control architecture. This learning architecture is validated in a hardware experiment consisting of a digging task using a KUKA LWR platform.},

Contraction theory enables constructing a policy that makes the closed-loop system trajectories inherently convergent towards a unique trajectory. At the technical level, identifying the contraction metric, which is the distance metric with respect to which a robot’s trajectories exhibit contraction is often non-trivial. We propose to jointly learn the control policy and its corresponding contraction metric while enforcing contraction. To achieve this, we learn an implicit dynamics model of the robotic system from an offline data set consisting of the robot’s state and input trajectories. We propose a data augmentation algorithm for learning contraction policies using this learned dynamics model. We randomly generate samples in the state space and propagate them forward in time through the learned dynamics model to generate auxiliary sample trajectories. We then learn both the control policy and the contraction metric such that the distance between the trajectories from the offline data set and our generated auxiliary sample trajectories decreases over time. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework on simulated robotic goal-reaching tasks and demonstrate that enforcing contraction results in faster convergence and greater robustness of the learned policy.},

  abstract = {Real-world autonomous systems are often controlled using conventional model-based control methods. But if accurate models of a system are not available, these methods may be unsuitable. For many safety-critical systems, such as robotic systems, a model of the system and a control strategy may be learned using data. When applying learning to safety-critical systems, guaranteeing safety during learning as well as testing/deployment is paramount. A variety of different approaches for ensuring safety exists, but the published works are cluttered and there are few reviews that compare the latest approaches. This paper reviews two promising approaches on guaranteeing safety for learning-based robust control of uncertain dynamical systems, which are based on control barrier functions and control Lyapunov functions. While control barrier functions provide an option to incorporate safety in terms of constraint satisfaction, control Lyapunov functions are used to define safety in terms of stability. This review categorises learning-based methods that use control barrier functions and control Lyapunov functions into three groups, namely reinforcement learning, online and offline supervised learning. Finally, the paper presents a discussion of the suitability of the different methods for different applications.},

  abstract = {Learning the dynamical system (DS) model from data that preserves dynamical system properties is an important problem in many robot learning applications. Typically, the joint data coming from cyber-physical systems, such as robots have some underlying DS properties associated with it, e.g., convergence, invariance to a set, etc. In this paper, a model learning method is developed such that the trajectories of the DS are invariant in a given compact set. Such invariant DS models can be used to generate trajectories of the robot that will always remain in a prescribed set. In order to achieve invariance to a set, Barrier certificates are employed. The DS is approximated using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and a parameter learning problem subject to Barrier certificates enforced at all the points in the prescribed set is solved. To solve an infinite constraint problem for enforcing Barrier Certificates at every point in a given compact set, a modified constraint is developed that is sufficient to hold the Barrier certificates in the entire set. An active sampling strategy is formulated to minimize the number of constraints in learning. Simulation results of ELM learning with and without Barrier certificates are presented which show the invariance property being preserved in the ELM learning when learning procedure involves Barrier constraints. The method is validated using experiments conducted on a robot arm recreating invariant trajectories inside a prescribed set.},

  abstract = {Catching a fast flying object is particularly challenging as it consists of two tasks: extremely precise estimation of the object's motion and control of the robot's motion. Any small imprecision may lead the fingers to close too abruptly and let the object fly away from the hand before closing. We present a strategy to overcome for sensorimotor imprecision by introducing softness in the catching approach. Soft catching consists of having the robot moves with the object for a short period of time, so as to leave more time for the fingers to close on the object. We use a dynamic system-based control law to generate the appropriate reach and follow motion, which is expressed as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system. We propose a method to approximate the parameters of LPV systems using Gaussian mixture models, based on a set of kinematically feasible demonstrations generated by an offline optimal control framework. We show theoretically that the resulting DS will intercept the object at the intercept point, at the right time with the desired velocity direction. Stability and convergence of the approach are assessed through Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed method is validated systematically to catch three objects that generate elastic contacts and demonstrate important improvement over a hard catching approach.},

Ensuring a smooth transition from free motion to contact is crucial as incurring a large impact force may lead to unstable contact with the robot bouncing on the surface, i.e., chattering. Stabilizing the forces at contact is not possible as the impact lasts for less than a millisecond, leaving no time for the robot to react to the impact force. We present a strategy in which the robot adapts its dynamic before entering into contact. The speed is modulated so as to align with the surface. We leverage the properties of autonomous dynamical systems for immediate re-planning and handling unforeseen perturbations and exploit local modulations of the dynamics to control for the smooth transitions at contact. We show theoretically and empirically that by using the modulation framework, the robot can stably touch the contact surface, even when the surface's location is uncertain, at a desired location, and finally, leave the surface or stop on the surface at a desired point.},

This formulation leads to solving a constrained quadratic program (QP) that includes a finite number of decision variables with an infinite number of constraints. Theorems are developed to relax the QP with infinite number of constraints to a QP with a finite number of constraints which can be practically implemented using a QP solver. In addition, an active sampling methodology is developed that further reduced the number of required constraints for the QP by only evaluating the constraints at a smaller subset of points.

Each controller is formulated as a polytopic Linear Parameter Varying system consisting in a set of vertex systems at the limit operation points. Then, the stability and operating properties can be assessed through Linear Matrix Inequalities, from which an optimality index can be obtained. This index is used by a genetic optimisation algorithm to iteratively generate new controller solutions towards the best one. To exemplify our method we choose a case study of modulation laws for tasks that require a physical interaction between human and robot. Generated solutions for different trade-offs are evaluated on a object handover scenario using a 7-DoF WAM robotic manipulator.},

  abstract = {This paper presents NAR-RM, a method for learning robot reaching motions from a set of demonstrations using Nonlinear AutoRegressive (NAR) polynomial models. Reaching motions are modeled as solutions to autonomous discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems, so that the movements started near the data of the demonstrations follow the trained trajectories and always reach and stop at the target. Since NAR models obtained using standard system identification techniques do not always adequately model the reaching motions, in this paper we present a method that uses a least-squares estimator with constraints to impose the location of fixed points in the model. With the imposition of new fixed points it is possible to change the location of the original fixed points of the model, thus allowing the learning of stable reaching motions. We evaluate our method using a library of human handwriting motions, a mobile robot and an industrial manipulator.},

  abstract = {Biological systems, including human beings, have the innate ability to perform complex tasks in versatile and agile manner. Researchers in sensorimotor control have tried to understand and formally define this innate property. The idea, supported by several experimental findings, that biological systems are able to combine and adapt basic units of motion into complex tasks finally lead to the formulation of the motor primitives theory. In this respect, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) represent an elegant mathematical formulation of the motor primitives as stable dynamical systems, and are well suited to generate motor commands for artificial systems like robots. In the last decades, DMPs have inspired researchers in different robotic fields including imitation and reinforcement learning, optimal control,physical interaction, and human-robot co-working, resulting a considerable amount of published papers. The goal of this tutorial survey is two-fold. On one side, we present the existing DMPs formulations in rigorous mathematical terms,and discuss advantages and limitations of each approach as well as practical implementation details. In the tutorial vein, we also search for existing implementations of presented approaches and release several others. On the other side, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of existing literature and categorize state of the art work on DMP. The paper concludes with a discussion on the limitations of DMPs and an outline of possible research directions.},

  abstract = {Non-linear dynamical systems represent a compact, flexible, and robust tool for reactive motion generation. The effectiveness of dynamical systems relies on their ability to accurately represent stable motions. Several approaches have been proposed to learn stable and accurate motions from demonstration. Some approaches work by separating accuracy and stability into two learning problems, which increases the number of open parameters and the overall training time. Alternative solutions exploit single-step learning but restrict the applicability to one regression technique. This paper presents a single-step approach to learn stable and accurate motions that work with any regression technique. The approach makes energy considerations on the learned dynamics to stabilize the system at run-time while introducing small deviations from the demonstrated motion. Since the initial value of the energy injected into the system affects the reproduction accuracy, it is estimated from training data using an efficient procedure. Experiments on a real robot and a comparison on a public benchmark shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In the robotic literature, dynamical system motions are typically planned without considering possible limitations in the robot's workspace. This work presents a novel approach to learn workspace constraints from human demonstrations and to generate motion trajectories for the robot that lie in the constrained workspace. Training data are incrementally clustered into different linear subspaces and used to fit a low dimensional representation of each subspace. By considering the learned constraint subspaces as zeroing barrier functions, we are able to design a control input that keeps the system trajectory within the learned bounds. This control input is effectively combined with the original system dynamics preserving eventual asymptotic properties of the unconstrained system.

By exploiting mathematical tools from differential geometry, the method ensures that the learned skills fulfill the geometric constraints imposed by the underlying manifolds, such as unit quaternion (UQ) for orientation and symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices for impedance, while preserving the convergence to a given target. The proposed approach is firstly tested in simulation on a public benchmark, obtained by projecting Cartesian data into UQ and SPD manifolds, and compared with existing approaches. Apart from evaluating the approach on a public benchmark, several experiments were performed on a real robot performing bottle stacking in different conditions and a drilling task in cooperation with a human operator. The evaluation shows promising results in terms of learning accuracy and task adaptation capabilities.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses a comprehensive framework for modular motor control based on a recently developed theory of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). DMPs are a formulation of movement primitives with autonomous nonlinear differential equations, whose time evolution creates smooth kinematic control policies. Model-based control theory is used to convert the outputs of these policies into motor commands. By means of coupling terms, on-line modifications can be incorporated into the time evolution of the differential equations, thus providing a rather flexible and reactive framework for motor planning and execution. The linear parameterization of DMPs lends itself naturally to supervised learning from demonstration. Moreover, the temporal, scale, and translation invariance of the differential equations with respect to these parameters provides a useful means for movement recognition. A novel reinforcement learning technique based on natural stochastic policy gradients allows a general approach of improving DMPs by trial and error learning with respect to almost arbitrary optimization criteria. We demonstrate the different ingredients of the DMP approach in various examples, involving skill learning from demonstration on the humanoid robot DB, and learning biped walking from demonstration in simulation, including self-improvement of the movement patterns towards energy efficiency through resonance tuning.},

Furthermore, we propose a constructive way of initiating the energy tanks via the concept of task energy. This represents an estimate of the energy consumption of a given force control task prior to execution. The controller can be applied to both rigid body and flexible joint dynamics.

  abstract = {The improved adaptability of a robotic teleoperation system to unexpected disturbances in remote environments can be achieved by compliance control. Nevertheless, complying with all types of interaction forces while performing realistic manipulation tasks may deteriorate the teleoperation performance. For instance, the loading effect of the objects and tools that are held and manipulated by the robot can introduce undesired deviations from the reference trajectories in case of low-stiffness (or high payload) teleoperation. Although this can be addressed by updating the robot dynamics with the external loading effect, a sudden loss of the object may also generate undesired and potentially dangerous robot behaviours. To address this problem, we propose a novel and self-adaptive teleoperation framework. The method uses the feedback from robot's force sensors to recognize the interaction aspects that must be compensated by robot dynamics. Thanks to this online compensation, the slave robot reduces the tracking error with respect to the commanded motion by the human operator, while performing complex interactive tasks without the haptic feedback. The robot local controller also includes an energy tank based passivity paradigm to be able to manage unexpected collisions or a contact loss without resulting in an unsafe behaviour. We validate the proposed approach by experiments on a torque-controlled robotic arm performing manipulation tasks that require both object manipulation and environment interaction.},

Our main goal is to improve the efficiency of bilateral teleoperation systems by reducing the human operator effort in programming the system. In fact, using this method virtual guidances do not need to be programmed a priori but they can be instead dynamically generated on-the-fly and updated at any time making, in the end, the system suitable for any unstructured environment. In addition, this methodology is easily adaptable to any kind of teleoperation system since it is independent from the used master/slave robots.

  abstract = {Learning from Demonstration depends on a robot learner generalising its learned model to unseen conditions. Generally, it is not feasible for a person to provide demonstrations that account for all possible variations in non-trivial tasks. While there are many learning methods that can handle interpolation of observed data effectively, extrapolation from observed data offers a much greater challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a modified Task-Parameterised Gaussian Mixture Regression method that considers the relevance of task parameters during trajectory generation, as determined by variance in the data. The benefits of the proposed method are first explored using a simulated reaching task data set. Here it is shown that the proposed method offers far-reaching, low-error extrapolation abilities that are different in nature to existing learning methods. Data collected from novice users for a real-world manipulation task is then considered, where it is shown that the proposed method is able to effectively reduce grasping performance errors by similar to 40\% and extrapolate to unseen grasp targets under real-world conditions. These results indicate the proposed method can benefit novice users by placing less reliance on the user to provide high quality demonstration data sets.},

  abstract = {Two simple and computationally efficient schemes for force tracking using impedance control are presented. The schemes generate the reference position trajectory required to produce a desired contact force despite lack of knowledge of the environmental stiffness and location. The first scheme uses direct adaptive control to generate the reference position on-line as a function of the force tracking-error. The second scheme utilizes an indirect adaptive strategy in which the environmental parameters are estimated on-line, and the required reference position is computed based on these estimates. Simulation studies are presented for a 7-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robotics research arm using full arm dynamics. It is shown that the adaptive schemes are able to compensate for uncertainties in both the environmental stiffness and location, so that the end-effector applies the desired contact force while exhibiting the specified impedance dynamics.{$<>$}},

This behavior by itself can violate stability. Therefore, a passivity analysis for the whole system is presented, and based on input power ports and the demonstrated reference power, a passivity observer (PO) is designed. Subsequently, a DMP phase altering law is introduced according to the passivity criterion in order to adjust the phase based on the passivity criterion.

  abstract = {Ideally, a robot controller should not only be designed to exhibit a given interaction behavior under controlled conditions, but also to be robust to changes e.g. in the environment. Within the paradigm of virtual energy tanks for passivity-based controls, robustness may be provided by setting absolute limits on the tank energy. However, an energy limit alone does not prevent a sudden drain of the tank, which may result in a sudden increase of potentially problematic, passivity-violating energy somewhere in the system. In this letter, we tackle this problem by regulating the exchanged power between the energy tank and the system according to a reference power trajectory. We propose a method to encode this trajectory and to conservatively learn the corresponding parameters. The resulting system is adaptable and robust to both predicted and unpredicted changes, either in the environment or the system. Experimental results with a Franka Emika Panda robot performing an exemplary force-based interaction task validate the performance improvement with our method.},

Novel adaptation laws are formulated for online adjustment of robot impedance based on human behavior. Two other sets of update rules are defined for intelligent coping with the robot's structured and unstructured uncertainties. These rules ensure stability via Lyapunov's theorem and provide uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop system's response, without a need for HRI force/torque measurement. Accordingly, the convergence of response signals, including errors in tracking, online impedance learning, robot parameter adaptation, and controller gain variation, is proven to operate in a bounded region (compact set) in the presence of robot and human uncertainties and bounded disturbances. The performance of the developed intelligent impedance-varying control strategy is investigated through comprehensive experimental studies in a repetitive following task with a moving target.},

In this manuscript, a survey on the applications of HRI is presented. These applications could be industrial, medical, agricultural, servical, and educational. HRI can be found in industrial applications in handling of the workpieces in the production lines, comanipulation tasks, welding processes, parts assembly, and painting. Assistive robotics are one from the highest profile areas in HRI. For people with the physical and the mental challenges, the robots can provide the opportunity of interaction and therapy. Furthermore, HRI can be widely applied in hospitals. Nowadays, HRI is very important to fight against the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In agriculture, the robot is able to help humans with many tasks such as harvesting, seeding, fertilizing, spraying, weed detection, hauling, and mowing. HRI is quite new in the field of education. However, the robot can help children in classrooms for learning processes. In addition, the robots can help young children empathy and social skills. HRI can be found in other applications such as home use, inventory management, mining, Space exploration, and UAVs.},

We demonstrate the proposed CDMP under different constraints on the end-effector movement such as obstacle avoidance and workspace constraints on a physical robot.

  abstract = {Control barrier functions have been demonstrated to be a useful method of ensuring constraint satisfaction for a wide class of controllers. However, the existing results are mostly restricted to continuous-time systems. Mechanical systems, including robots, are typically second-order systems in which the control occurs at the force/torque level. These systems have actuator, velocity, and position constraints (i.e., relative degree two) that are vital for safety and/or task execution. Additionally, mechanical systems are typically controlled digitally as sampled-data systems. The contribution of this article is twofold. The first contribution is the development of novel, robust control barrier functions that ensure constraint satisfaction for sampled-data systems in the presence of model uncertainty and allows for satisfaction of actuator constraints. The second contribution is the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of robotic grasping in which a robotic hand must ensure that an object remains inside the grasp while manipulating it to the desired reference trajectory. A grasp constraint satisfying controller is proposed that can admit the existing nominal manipulation controllers from the literature while simultaneously ensuring no slip, no overextension (e.g., singular configurations), and no rolling off of the fingertips. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed control for the robotic hand application.},

  abstract = {Performing manipulation tasks interactively in real environments requires a high degree of accuracy and stability. At the same time, when one cannot assume a fully deterministic and static environment, one must endow the robot with the ability to react rapidly to sudden changes in the environment. These considerations make the task of reach and grasp difficult to deal with. We follow a Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach to the problem and take inspiration from the way humans adapt their reach and grasp motions when perturbed. This is in sharp contrast to previous work in PbD that uses unperturbed motions for training the system and then applies perturbation solely during the testing phase. In this work, we record the kinematics of arm and fingers of human subjects during unperturbed and perturbed reach and grasp motions. In the perturbed demonstrations, the target’s location is changed suddenly after the onset of the motion. Data show a strong coupling between the hand transport and finger motions. We hypothesize that this coupling enables the subject to seamlessly and rapidly adapt the finger motion in coordination with the hand posture. To endow our robot with this competence, we develop a coupled dynamical system based controller, whereby two dynamical systems driving the hand and finger motions are coupled. This offers a compact encoding for reach-to-grasp motions that ensures fast adaptation with zero latency for re-planning. We show in simulation and on the real iCub robot that this coupling ensures smooth and “human-like” motions. We demonstrate the performance of our model under spatial, temporal and grasp type perturbations which show that reaching the target with coordinated hand–arm motion is necessary for the success of the task.},

  abstract = {It is essential for the robot manipulator to adapt to unexpected events and dynamic environments while executing the physical contact-rich tasks. Although a range of methods have been investigated to enhance the adaptability and generalization capability of robot manipulation, it is still difficult to perform complex contact-rich tasks, e.g., rolling pizza dough and robot-assisted medical scanning, without the assistance from a human in the loop. We proposed a novel framework combining learning from demonstration (LfD) and human experience to enhance the safety and adaptability of the robot manipulation. In this framework, dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) is employed for manipulation skills learning from demonstrations, and human correction is applied to update the pre-trained DMPs skills model. We conducted experiments on the Franka Emika Panda Robot with pizza dough rolling tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework could effectively improve the performance of the physical contact-rich tasks, and the human correction method through teleoperation provides a potential solution for advanced interaction tasks with complex and dynamic physical properties.},

The composite DMPs could encode the position and orientation manipulation skills simultaneously for human-to-robot skills transfer. As the robot manipulator is expected to perform tasks in unstructured and uncertain environments, it requires the manipulator to own the adaptive ability to adjust its behaviours to new situations and environments. Since the DMPs can adapt to uncertainties and perturbation, and spatial and temporal scaling, it has been successfully employed for various tasks, such as trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance. However, the existing skill model mainly focuses on position or orientation modelling separately; it is a common constraint in terms of position and orientation simultaneously in practice. Besides, the generalisation of the skill learning model based on DMPs is still hard to deal with dynamic tasks, e.g., reaching a moving target and obstacle avoidance. In this paper, we proposed a composite DMPs-based framework representing position and orientation simultaneously for robot skill acquisition and the neural networks technique is used to train the skill model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by simulation and experiments.},

  abstract = {The notable performance exhibited by impedance controllers during robotic interaction has led to the widespread use of this control methodology. Improved position and interaction control might be attainable through utilisation of variable impedance control (VIC) techniques. Interactional performance could be further improved by combining structural compliance with VIC. However, utilization of VIC tends to induce energy-injecting elements, which could impact on a robotic system's stability/passivity. Additionally, implementation of active VIC techniques on passively compliant robots has not been investigated (although several works consider VIC using variable stiffness actuators), which renders the existing rigid-joint robot, passivity-inducing control schemes inapplicable to compliant systems. To this end, the work presented here introduces a novel scheme, termed passivity-preservation control (PPC), which suppresses the energy injections that could be introduced into compliant robots, as a result of VIC. Compared to tank-based VIC approaches the PPC scheme is directly applicable to flexible-joint robots, even ones with nonlinear passive stiffness elements, while its performance is independent of the tank-energy levels. Moreover, the proposed scheme permits stable VIC using full-state feedback, thereby enabling impedance modulations relating to both motor and link-side variables. Consequently, full-state feedback gains can be generated via linear quadratic regulator optimisation, thus enabling application of gain-scheduling techniques on flexible-joint robots for enhanced position control. Passivity and stability analyses are performed for joint and Cartesian-space versions of the PPC scheme, which justify their applicability to both interaction and “free-motion” scenarios. The PPC scheme's efficacy, compared to constant gain impedance methods, in terms of convergence and interactional performance, is corroborated via simulation and experimental means involving the Sawyer robot, which is powered by series elastic actuators. Theoretical and experimental results mathematically and practically verify VIC stability, thus enabling flexible-joint robots to more accurately mimic biologically inspired behaviors.},

  abstract = {Motor skills are essential for robots to accomplish complicated and dexterous manipulation tasks, which are difficult to be mastered through traditional controller designs. Currently, robots learning from demonstrations enable them to learn control policies automatically from human motor demonstrations. However, the nonlinearity and instantaneousness of the demonstrated forces prohibit robots from fully mastering the motor skill features by simply exploiting force examples. Therefore, a self-improvement learning scheme is required to refine the control policy further until satisfactory motor skills are acquired. Hence, this paper combines learning from demonstrations and reinforcement learning to learn a controller for complex motor skills. The proposed method is validated on an IIWA KUKA robot, performing a specified nonprehensile manipulation task. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this paper originates from the requirement to develop an efficient and fast learning algorithm that improves the robot skill learning efficiency. Specifically, our research focuses on the nonprehensile manipulation task, easily subject to environmental changes. Therefore, the robot must continuously interact with the environment to master the skill. To accelerate the skill learning process, learning from demonstrations initializes the control policies, and then the robot starts to practice the demonstrated skill. After each practice round, the robot receives a reward from the environment, and based on the reinforcement learning algorithm limited up to 100 trials, the robot masters the nonprehensile manipulation skill.},

Novel constraints on variable impedance profiles are given to guarantee the exponential stability of the desired variable impedance dynamics. An ADI-based impedance control law is designed to achieve the desired variable impedance dynamics through the convergence of a variable impedance error. Based on the extended Tikhonovs theorem, it is proven that the closed-loop control system has semiglobal practical exponential stability. The proposed impedance controller can be implemented in a PID form and is appealing for its simple structure, easy implementation, and control stability guarantee.

  abstract = {In this survey we present the current status on robots performing manipulation tasks that require varying contact with the environment, such that the robot must either implicitly or explicitly control the contact force with the environment to complete the task. Robots can perform more and more manipulation tasks that are still done by humans, and there is a growing number of publications on the topics of 1) performing tasks that always require contact and 2) mitigating uncertainty by leveraging the environment in tasks that, under perfect information, could be performed without contact. The recent trends have seen robots perform tasks earlier left for humans, such as massage, and in the classical tasks, such as peg-in-hole, there is more efficient generalization to other similar tasks, better error tolerance, and faster planning or learning of the tasks. Thus, in this survey we cover the current stage of robots performing such tasks, starting from surveying all the different in-contact tasks robots can perform, observing how these tasks are controlled and represented, and finally presenting the learning and planning of the skills required to complete these tasks.},

Since these robots are expected to co-habit the same environment with a human user, analysing and ensuring their safety is an important requirement. Safety analysis of domestic robots determine whether a robot achieves a desired safety level according to some quantitative safety metrics. When it comes to controller design for human friendly robots, it often involves introducing compliance and ensuring asymptotic stability using impedance control technique and passivity theories. The controller proposed in this work also uses a passive design that extends the standard impedance control scheme with energy and power based safety metrics to ensure that safety requirements defined in these norms are achieved by domestic robots. The effectiveness of the proposed guideline is illustrated with simulation and experimental results.},

In reinforcement learning with DMPs, usually goals and temporal scaling parameters are predefined and only the weights for shaping a DMP are learned. Many tasks, however, exist where the best goal position is not a priori known, requiring to learn it. Thus, here we specifically address the question of how to simultaneously combine goal and shape parameter learning. This is a difficult problem because learning of both parameters could easily interfere in a destructive way. We apply value function approximation techniques for goal learning and direct policy search methods for shape learning. Specifically, we use “policy improvement with path integrals” and “natural actor critic” for the policy search. We solve a learning-to-pour-liquid task in simulations as well as using a Pa10 robot arm. Results for learning from scratch, learning initialized by human demonstration, as well as for modifying the tool for the learned DMPs are presented. We observe that the combination of goal and shape learning is stable and robust within large parameter regimes. Learning converges quickly even in the presence of disturbances, which makes this combined method suitable for robotic applications.},

  abstract = {Programming robotic assembly tasks usually requires delicate force tuning. In contrast, human may accomplish assembly tasks with much less time and fewer trials. It will be a great benefit if robots can learn the human inherent skill of force control and apply it autonomously. Recent works on Learning from Demonstration (LfD) have shown the possibility to teach robots by human demonstration. The basic idea is to collect the force and corrective velocity that human applies during assembly, and then use them to regress a proper gain for the robot admittance controller. However, many of the LfD methods are tested on collaborative robots with compliant joints and relatively large assembly clearance. For industrial robots, the non-backdrivable mechanism and strict tolerance requirement make the assembly tasks more challenging. This paper modifies the original LfD to be suitable for industrial robots. A new demonstration tool is designed to acquire the human demonstration data. The force control gains are learned by Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and the closed-loop stability is analysed. A series of peg-hole-insertion experiments with H7h7 tolerance on a FANUC manipulator validate the performance of the proposed learning method.},

The improved BLF-based control renders the entire constrained task space positively invariant. Despite transient perturbations by external forces and online parameter adaptation, practical tracking of the reference trajectory is achieved without transgression of the constrained task space. In the absence of interaction forces, asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectory is achieved.},

A common approach to solve this problem is the framework of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), where the observed agent, e.g., a human demonstrator, is assumed to behave according to an intrinsic cost function that reflects its intent and informs its control actions. In this work, we reformulate the IRL inference problem to learning control Lyapunov functions (CLF) from demonstrations by exploiting the inverse optimality property, which states that every CLF is also a meaningful value function. Moreover, the derived CLF formulation directly guarantees stability of the system under the inferred control policies.

A major challenge for medical robots is the complex physical interaction between the robot and the patients which is required to be safe. This work presents the preliminary evaluation of a recently introduced control architecture based on the Fractal Impedance Control (FIC) in medical applications. The deployed FIC architecture is robust to delay between the master and the replica robots. It can switch online between an admittance and impedance behaviour, and it is robust to interaction with unstructured environments. Our experiments analyse three scenarios: teleoperated surgery, rehabilitation, and remote ultrasound scan. The experiments did not require any adjustment of the robot tuning, which is essential in medical applications where the operators do not have an engineering background required to tune the controller. Our results show that is possible to teleoperate the robot to cut using a scalpel, do an ultrasound scan, and perform remote occupational therapy. However, our experiments also highlighted the need for a better robots embodiment to precisely control the system in 3D dynamic tasks.},

  abstract = {The ability of animals to interact with complex dynamics is unmatched in robots. Especially important to the interaction performances is the online adaptation of body dynamics, which can be modelled as an impedance behaviour. However, variable impedance control still continues to be a challenge in the current control frameworks due to the difficulties of retaining stability when adapting the controller gains. The fractal impedance controller has recently been proposed to solve this issue. However, it still has limitations such as sudden jumps in force when it starts to converge to the desired position and the lack of a force feedback loop. In this manuscript, two improvements are made to the control framework to solve these limitations. The force discontinuity has been addressed introducing a modulation of the impedance via a virtual antagonist that modulates the output force. The force tracking has been modelled after the parallel force/position controller architecture. In contrast to traditional methods, the fractal impedance controller enables the implementation of a search algorithm on the force feedback to adapt its behaviour to the external environment instead of on relying on a priori knowledge of the external dynamics. Preliminary simulation results presented in this paper show the feasibility of the proposed approach, and it allows to evaluate the trade-off that needs to be made when relying on the proposed controller for interaction. In conclusion, the proposed method mimics the behaviour of an agonist/antagonist system adapting to unknown external dynamics, and it may find application in computational neuroscience, haptics, and interaction control.},

Studying biological motor control can provide insights into overcoming these limitations due to the high dexterity and stability observable in humans and animals. This work presents a geometrical solution to the postural optimisation of 7-DoF limbs-like mechanisms, which are robust to singularities and computationally efficient. The theoretical formulation identified two separate decoupled optimisation strategies. The shoulder and elbow strategy align the plane of motion with the expected plane of motion and guarantee the reachability of the end-posture. The wrist strategy ensures the end-effector orientation, which is essential to retain manipulability when nearing a singular configuration. The numerical results confirmed the theoretical observations and allowed us to identify the effect of different grasp strategies on system manipulability. The geometrical method was numerically tested in thousands of configurations proving to be both robust and accurate. The tested scenarios include left and right arm postures, singular configurations, and walking scenarios. The proposed geometrical approach can find application in developing efficient and robust interaction controllers that could be applied in computational neuroscience and robotics.},

  abstract = {Safe and compliant control of dynamic systems in interaction with the environment, e.g., in shared workspaces, continues to represent a major challenge. Mismatches in the dynamic model of the robots, numerical singularities, and the intrinsic environmental unpredictability are all contributing factors. Online optimization of impedance controllers has recently shown great promise in addressing this challenge, however, their performance is not sufficiently robust to be deployed in challenging environments. This work proposes a compliant control method for redundant manipulators based on a superimposition of multiple passive task-space controllers in a hierarchy. Our control framework of passive controllers is inherently stable, numerically well-conditioned (as no matrix inversions are required), and computationally inexpensive (as no optimization is used). We leverage and introduce a novel stiffness profile for a recently proposed passive controller with smooth transitions between the divergence and convergence phases making it particularly suitable when multiple passive controllers are combined through superimposition. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves sub-centimeter tracking performance during demanding dynamic tasks with fast-changing references, while remaining safe to interact with and robust to singularities. he proposed framework achieves such results without knowledge of the robot dynamics and thanks to its passivity is intrinsically stable. The data further show that the robot can fully take advantage of the redundancy to maintain the primary task accuracy while compensating for unknown environmental interactions, which is not possible from current frameworks that require accurate contact information.},

The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only provides safe interaction of the robot arm with a person, but also improves the effectiveness of contact task performance. The paper also presents a novel concept of avoidance of an obstacle of unknown shape. The tactile sensory ability of the developed manipulator allows robot links to follow the object contour and to perform motion planning in the dynamic environment. The information on the applied normal force vector, object shape and target point coordinates is supplied to the motion planning system. The algorithms for contact point detection, object geometry recognition, and estimation of contacting object stiffness are detailed. The numerical simulation elicits a capability of the proposed method to approximate various object shapes precisely. The experimental results showed that the local admittance control and motion planner allowed the end-effector to follow the object contour in a very smooth, consistent manner while reaching the target point.},

Impedance/admittance controls are effective for achieving the restraint; however, they require adjustment of the kinematic impedance, which may induce instability. We proposed a force restrain method while PD controller is used for avoiding unstable robot behavior. This method alters position command in case the robot may give extreme force which leads to damaging objects. This method expands the trajectory planning and motion generation area practically because it can be executed under the condition that the controller autonomously restrains excessive force. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, we experimented with contact and detach motion in 1- and 2- DoF translational directions.},

Most of the existing approaches separate learning, i.e., the system identification based on a fixed dataset, and control, i.e., the execution of the model-based control law. This separation makes the performance highly sensitive to the initial selection of training data and possibly requires very large datasets. This article proposes a learning feedback linearizing control law using online closed-loop identification. The employed Gaussian process model updates its training data only if the model uncertainty becomes too large. This event-triggered online learning ensures high data efficiency and thereby reduces computational complexity, which is a major barrier for using Gaussian processes under real-time constraints. We propose safe forgetting strategies of data points to adhere to budget constraints and to further increase data efficiency. We show asymptotic stability for the tracking error under the proposed event-triggering law and illustrate the effective identification and control in simulation.},

Example applications include autonomous robots in unstructured environments, human behavior modeling for prediction and action recognition in human–machine-interaction, and chemical process industry. In many of these cases, classical system identification is challenging, because a parametric model structure is unknown. Data-driven nonparametric models such as Gaussian process state–space models (GPSSMs) offer a suitable alternative: GPSSMs are known for their data-efficiency and rely on Bayesian principles to include prior knowledge. However, properties like stability or boundedness are often known a priori, but rarely exploited during modeling. We therefore propose a novel approach for learning GPSSMs subject to stability constraints. Our approach enforces the convergence using control Lyapunov functions which are also obtained in a data-driven fashion. We analyze the resulting dynamics with respect to convergence radius and data collection. In simulation, we illustrate the precision of the identified model on a real-world dataset of goal-directed motions.},

  abstract = {Data-driven approaches are well suited to represent human motion because arbitrary complex trajectories can be captured. Gaussian process state space models allow to encode human motion while quantifying uncertainty due to missing data. Such human motion models are relevant for many application domains such as learning by demonstration and motion prediction in human-robot collaboration. For goal-directed tasks it is essential to impose stability constraints on the model representing the human motion. Motivated by learning by demonstration applications, this paper proposes an uncertainty-based control Lyapunov function approach for goal-directed path tracking. We exploit the model fidelity which is related to the location of the training and test data: Our approach actively strives into regions with more demonstration data and thus higher model certainty. This achieves accurate reproduction of the human motion independent of the initial condition and we show that generated trajectories are uniformly globally asymptotically stable. The approach is validated in a nonlinear learning by demonstration task where human-demonstrated motions are reproduced by the learned dynamical system, and higher precision than competitive state of the art methods is achieved.

Recent advances in reactive motion generation have shown that learning adaptive, reactive, smooth, and stable vector fields is possible. However, these approaches define vector fields on a flat Euclidean manifold, while representing vector fields for orientations requires modeling the dynamics in non-Euclidean manifolds, such as Lie Groups. In this paper, we present a novel vector field model that can guarantee most of the properties of previous approaches i.e., stability, smoothness, and reactivity beyond the Euclidean space. In the experimental evaluation, we show the performance of our proposed vector field model to learn stable vector fields for full robot poses as SE(2) and SE(3) in both simulated and real robotics tasks.},

It turns out that port-based network models of physical systems immediately lend themselves to a Hamiltonian description. While the usual geometric approach to Hamiltonian systems is based on the canonical symplectic structure of the phase space or on a Poisson structure that is obtained by (symmetry) reduction of the phase space, in the case of a port-Hamiltonian system the geometric structure derives from the interconnection of its sub-systems. This motivates to consider Dirac structures instead of Poisson structures, since this notion enables one to define Hamiltonian systems with algebraic constraints. As a result, any power-conserving interconnection of port-Hamiltonian systems again defines a port-Hamiltonian system.},

  abstract = {Modern robotic systems are increasingly expected to interact with unstructured and unpredictable environments. This has reiterated the importance of sophisticated reasoning and adaptive motor skill learning. Although low-level methodologies for sensorimotor control have been relatively well studied, constrained motion for robotic manipulators in general environments still remains a challenge. In addition to viable kinematic trajectories, successful interaction requires a system to adjust the magnitude and direction of the force applied on an object or human being. One force control architecture that is stable under a wide range of conditions is impedance control. However the defining inertial, damping and stiffness parameters are highly task dependent and often difficult to deduce a priori. To this end, one promising strategy is through reinforcement learning. Several frameworks have already emerged that are capable of learning compliant behaviour in this fashion. However the complex and sometimes discontinuous nature of physical interaction in robotics provides additional challenges in designing algorithms capable of learning complex behaviours with minimal interaction time. This thesis details an extension to the PILCO algorithm for learning variable impedance control. The proposed method attempts to construct a Gaussian Process model of the robot-environment system through interaction. This approach permits long-term inference and planning in a fully Bayesian manner, reducing the required interaction time for convergence and allow for efficient analytical gradient-based policy updates. Two skill learning problems are investigated both in simulation and experiment on a 7-DOF `KUKA LBR iiwa 7 R800' robot. The first scenario entails learning state-conditioned variable stiffness parameters along predefined motion plans. In the second framework, the agent learns both stiffness parameters and kinematic trajectories simultaneously to complete a constrained motion task.},

An interaction contact force between the robot end-effector and its environment was represented and analyzed using the full mechanical second-order system and individual spring model. A position-based impedance controller is used to receive a contact force signal to track the constant desired force. The proposed approach tracks the desired contact force and reference trajectory based on reference position and velocity. This OSRDF controller is implemented by adjusting the online stiffness parameter and merging the inverse damping force with the force tracking error to compensate for the unknown environment and reduce the force error to zero. A Lyapunov function is applied to investigate the stability of the OSRDF impedance controller during implementation. Simulation studies and experimental tests on a seven degree of freedom (7DOF) robot manipulator are performed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method compared to the traditional constant impedance controller. The results showed the validity and effectiveness of the OSRDF method and revealed a relationship between the end-effector velocity and force tracking error. The proposed approach improves force tracking accuracy with simpler computational processes in simulation and practice.},

One approach to handle interaction forces is admittance control. Therein, position or speed reference values are modified based on interaction forces. To this end, the underlying position control scheme, widely used in industrial manipulators, is augmented with an additional admittance control loop. It is well known that such approaches raise stability issues in the interaction with stiff environments (termed contact stability). As a consequence, in traditional admittance control, the speed of operation needs to be reduced in order to prevent excessive contact force magnitudes and to ensure stability. In this paper, we propose an MPC-based admittance control scheme to circumvent both and discuss its properties and difficulties for practical use.},

  abstract = {Robot automatic assembly of weak stiffness parts is difficult due to potential deformation during assembly. The robot manipulation cannot adapt to the dynamic contact changes during the assembly process. A robot assembly skill learning system is designed by combining the compliance control and deep reinforcement, which could acquire a better robot assembly strategy. In this paper, a robot assembly strategy learning method based on variable impedance control is proposed to solve the robot assembly contact tasks. During the assembly process, the quality evaluation is designed based on fuzzy logic, and the impedance parameters in the assembly process are studied with a deep deterministic policy gradient. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified using the KUKA iiwa robot in the weak stiffness peg-in-hole assembly. Experimental results show that the robot obtains the robot assembly strategy with variable compliant in the process of weak stiffness peg-in-hole assembly. Compared with the previous methods, the assembly success rate of the proposed method reaches 100\%.},

Examples of Riemannian data in robotics include stiffness (symmetric and positive definite matrix (SPD)) and orientation (unit quaternion (UQ)) trajectories. For Riemannian data, unlike Euclidean ones, different dimensions are interconnected by geometric constraints which have to be properly considered during the learning process. Using distance preserving mappings, our approach transfers the data between their original manifold and the tangent space, realizing the removing and re-fulfilling of the constraints. This allows to extend existing frameworks to learn stable skills from Riemannian data while guaranteeing the stability of the learning results. The ability of RiemannianFlow to learn various data patterns and the stability of the learned models are experimentally shown on a dataset of manifold motions. Further, we analyze from different perspectives the robustness of the model with different hyperparameter combinations. While stability is not affected by different hyperparameters, a proper choice of the hyperparameters leads to a significant improvement (up to 27.6\%) in the model accuracy. Last, we show the effectiveness of RiemannianFlow in a real peg-in-hole (PiH) task where we need to generate stable and consistent position and orientation trajectories for the robot starting from different initial poses.},

Specially, DNN is introduced to fit the target nonlinear function with the demonstrated trajectory information, instead of using a specific formula to describe the forcing term in DMP. Thus, improved DMP method can avoid the drawback of conventional DMP. Simulation work is conducted and the results show that the invalidation performance of forcing term is improved compared with conventional DMP. In addition, the generalization property of improved DMP is also beneficial to work environmental adaptability.},

  abstract = {Smooth behaviors are preferable for many contact-rich manipulation tasks. Impedance control arises as an effective way to regulate robot movements by mimicking a mass-spring-damping system. Consequently, the robot behavior can be determined by the impedance gains. However, tuning the impedance gains for different tasks is tricky, especially for unstructured environments. Moreover, online adapting the optimal gains to meet the time-varying performance index is even more challenging. In this paper, we present Safe Online Gain Optimization for Variable Impedance Control (Safe OnGO-VIC). By reformulating the dynamics of impedance control as a control-affine system, in which the impedance gains are the inputs, we provide a novel perspective to understand variable impedance control. Additionally, we innovatively formulate an optimization problem with online collected force information to obtain the optimal impedance gains in real-time. Safety constraints are also embedded in the proposed framework to avoid unwanted collisions. We experimentally validated the proposed algorithm on three manipulation tasks. Comparison results with a constant gain baseline and an adaptive control method prove that the proposed algorithm is effective and generalizable to different scenarios.},

With the stability conditions and the estimated stability region, this paper aims to conveniently get rid of the unstable controller or controller with relatively small stability region. With this evaluation, the learning human strategy controller becomes much more robust to perturbations. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the criterion to verify the stability and a method to estimate the domain of attraction are provided for the learning controllers trained with support vector machines (SVMs). Conditions are formulated based on the discrete-time system Lyapunov theory to ensure that a closed-form of the learning control system is strongly stable under perturbations (SSUP). Then a Chebychev point based approach is proposed to estimate its domain of attraction. Findings Some of such learning controllers have been implemented in the vertical balance control of a dynamically stable, statically unstable wheel mobile robot.},

  abstract = {Impedance control is a very classic control method in robot and human interaction. Humans use their ability to adaptively adjust arm impedance parameters to perform well in a variety of tasks. This ability allows us to successfully complete interactive tasks even in uncertain disturbance environments. By analyzing the results of many force field experiments, We got a conclusion that humans usually use two methods to change their impedance in external perturbations: 1) In the situation of unpredictable perturbations, humans adapt their impedance through muscle contraction; 2) In the situation of predictable perturbations, humans adds a constant term to offset the known perturbations. In this paper, We show how 3-DOFs simulated robot use the reinforcement learning algorithm to perform similar behavior in both situations. We apply our model-free reinforcement learning algorithm PI2 (policy improvement with path integrals) to the robot to learn the end-effector variable impedance schedules and trajectories. Our findings provide a approach to automatically learn the impedance empirically without requiring to build a physical or environmental dynamics model.},

Furthermore, the full Cartesian impedance of the robot is formulated through an optimal control problem, i.e., the Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR), in which the task stiffness geometry (extracted from human demonstrations) is considered as the time-varying weighting matrix Q. The optimal impedance is eventually realised by the robot through a task geometry consistent Cartesian impedance controller. A tank-based passivity observer is implemented to give evidence on the stability of the system during online impedance variations. To evaluate the performance of the framework, a comparative experiment with three different impedance settings (i.e., the proposed framework, the framework without LQR and the framework without GMM/GMR) for Franka Emika Panda to perform a door opening task was conducted.

It is different from the traditional teaching by demonstration. The proposed method updates the reference trajectory in a gradual learning manner that is based on spatial domain analysis, which addresses limits in the time-based learning in the existing literature. As the learning time period is not fixed, this approach can be used in more general tracking tasks. Stability of the control system is guaranteed by rigorous Lyapunov-stability analysis. In the end, simulation results show that the proposed spatial repetitive learning control method is effective.},

To emulate such motions we propose an adaptive motor controller (AMC) allowing for spatial-temporal adaptation of human-like motor control. The AMC is a biomimetic controller consisting of online force and impedance (i.e., stiffness and damping) adaptation to different tasks and unknown arm dynamics. As a result, the AMC can produce more accurate and stable human-like reaching and tracking behaviors, compared to conventional controllers. Moreover, the reproduced spatial-temporal adaptation is comparable to that found in the experiments of human motor control.

The SEED model consists of a feedforward Gaussian motor primitive (GATE) neural network and an adaptive feedback impedance (AIM) mechanism. Sensorimotor weights over trials are learned in the GATE network, while the AIM mechanism is used to online tune impedance gains in a trial. The model was validated by periodic and non-periodic tracking tasks on a two-joint robot arm. As a result, the proposed model enables the arm to stably learn the tasks within 10 trials, compared to thousands of trials required by state-of-art deep learning. This model facilitates the exploration of unknown arm dynamics, in which the elbow joint requires much less active control compared to the shoulder. This control goes below 3\% of the overall effort. This finding complies with a proximal–distal control gradient in human arm control. Taken together, the proposed SEED model paves a way for implementing data-efficient sensorimotor learning and adaptation of human-like arm movement.},

The proposed approach employs an iterative scheme where a learner and a verifier interact to synthesize safe DNN controllers. The learner trains a DNN controller via deep reinforcement learning, and the verifier certifies the learned controller through computing a maximal safe initial region and its corresponding barrier certificate, based on polynomial abstraction and bilinear matrix inequalities solving. Compared with the existing verification-in-the-loop synthesis methods, our iterative framework is a sequential synthesis scheme of controllers and barrier certificates, which can learn safe controllers with adaptive barrier certificates rather than user-defined ones. We implement the tool SRLBC and evaluate its performance over a set of benchmark examples. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach efficiently synthesizes safe DNN controllers even for a nonlinear system with dimension up~to 12.},

Of such systems are considered personal and professional service robots which collaborate and interact with humans at diverse applications environments. In this collaboration, human safety is an important factor in the wider field of human-robot interaction (HRI) since it facilitates their harmonic coexistence. The paper at hand aims to systemize the recent literature by describing the required levels of safety during human-robot interaction, focusing on the core functions of the collaborative robots when performing specific processes. It is also oriented towards the existing methods for psychological safety during human-robot collaboration and its impact at the robot behaviour, while also discusses in depth the psychological parameters of robots incorporation in industrial and social environments. Based on the existing works on safety features that minimize the risk of HRI, a classification of the existing works into five major categories namely, Robot Perceptions for Safe HRI, Cognition-enabled robot control in HRI, Action Planning for safe navigation close to humans, Hardware safety features, and Societal and Psychological factors is also applied. Finally, the current study further discusses the existing risk assessment techniques as methods to offer additional safety in robotic systems presenting thus a holistic analysis of the safety in contemporary robots, and proposes a roadmap for safety compliance features during the development of a robotic system.},

The state-of-the-art approaches can hardly learn complete compliant profiles for a specific task. Comparatively, our model can encode task-specific parametric movement trajectories, correspondingly associated with dynamic trajectories including both impedance and feedforward force profiles. The compliant profiles are learned based on a biomimetic control strategy derived from the human motor learning in the muscle space, enabling the robot to simultaneously learn the impedance and the force while executing the movement trajectories obtained from human demonstration. Furthermore, both the kinematic and the dynamic profiles are learned in the parametric space, thus enabling the representation of a skill using corresponding parameters (i.e, task-specific parameters). Hl-CMps can allow the robot to automatically learn compliant behaviors in an online manner after kinematic demonstration. Our approach is validated by an insertion task and a cutting task based on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot.},

  abstract = {Purpose Teaching by demonstration (TbD) is a promising way for robot learning skills in human and robot collaborative hybrid manufacturing lines. Traditionally, TbD systems have only concentrated on how to enable robots to learn movement skills from humans. This paper aims to develop an extended TbD system which can also enable learning stiffness regulation strategies from humans.Design/methodology/approach Here, the authors propose an extended dynamical motor primitives (DMP) framework to achieve this goal. In addition to the advantages of the traditional ones, the authors’ framework can enable robots to simultaneously learn stiffness and the movement from human demonstrations. Additionally, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to capture the features of movement and of stiffness from multiple demonstrations of the same skill. Human limb surface electromyography (sEMG) signals are estimated to obtain the reference stiffness profiles.Findings The authors have experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. It shows that the authors approach could allow the robot to execute tasks in a variable impedance control mode with the learned movement trajectories and stiffness profiles.Originality/value In robot skill acquisition, DMP is widely used to encode robotic behaviors. So far, however, these DMP modes do not provide the ability to properly represent and generalize stiffness profiles. The authors argue that both movement trajectories and stiffness profiles should be considered equally in robot skill learning. The authors’ approach has great potential of applications in the future hybrid manufacturing lines.},

In this article, we develop such a physical human-robot interaction system which allows robots to learn variable impedance skills from human demonstrations. Specifically, the biological signals, i.e., surface electromyography are utilized for the extraction of human arm stiffness features during the task demonstration. The estimated human arm stiffness is then mapped into a robot impedance controller. The dynamics of both movement and stiffness are simultaneously modeled by using a model combining the hidden semi-Markov model and the Gaussian mixture regression. More importantly, the correlation between the movement information and the stiffness information is encoded in a systematic manner. This approach enables capturing uncertainties over time and space and allows the robot to satisfy both position and stiffness requirements in a task with modulation of the impedance controller.

In terms of these problems, this paper proposes an adaptive neural synchronized impedance controller (ANSIC) for cooperative manipulators processing. The proposed method includes two non-parallel control loops of the cooperative system to achieve and guarantee the desired movement trajectory and manufacturing force of the cooperation task. In the inner position tracking loop, an adaptive RBF-neural network based synchronization sliding controller is designed to simultaneously estimate the uncertain dynamic parameters of the robotic manipulators and improve the cooperative position tracking precision. In the outer force tracking loop, another RBF-neural network is applied to reform the impedance control model automatically and compensate the position and stiffness errors of the uncertain workpiece environment. Mathematical proof and experiments under various conditions are conducted. The results demonstrate the effective convergences of both the cooperative processing trajectory and force despite the uncertain environments.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the motion planning of the manipulator in task space. To improve the overall trajectory performance, a special motion planning method based on DMPs (Dynamic Movement Primitives) and the modified obstacle-avoiding algorithm is proposed. The proposed method solves the problems of trajectory jitter and inability to avoid obstacles in some scenarios, which are faced by the scheme of steering angle. Besides, it improves the retention of teaching intentions, reduces the loss of free space, and helps the system adapt to the dynamic environment. At the theoretical level, the convergence of the target state has been proved using Lyapunov stability theory-based analysis. The availability of the proposed method is validated and analyzed by performing a series of numerical simulations and Baxter robot experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method can provide reliable solutions for motion planning. Note to Practitioners—From the perspective of demonstration learning, this paper aims to elevate the motion planning of the manipulator in task space, especially in improving the obstacle avoidance performance. The existing DMPs-based motion planning algorithm uses the scheme of steering angle to achieve obstacle avoidance, and the obstacle is regarded as a mesh of points on the boundary. The obstacle-avoiding performance is limited. How to combine the obstacle-avoiding algorithm with the DMPs-based motion planning algorithm more effectively, so as to simultaneously achieve retaining teaching intentions as much as possible, still faces challenges. This paper designs a modified obstacle-avoiding algorithm, which solves the problems of trajectory jitter and inability to avoid obstacles in some circumstances, and improves the retention of teaching intentions. The modified obstacle-avoiding algorithm is also applied to the dynamic environment. The proposed method satisfies Lyapunov stability theory-based analysis, and the experiments on Baxter robot verify the feasibility.},

After investigating various design approaches for variable stiffness actuated (VSA) robots, currently the focus is shifting to the control of these systems. Control of VSA robots is challenging due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of their dynamicsdynamics and the need to satisfy constraints on input and state variables. Contrary to the partially open-loop state-of-the-art approaches, in this paper, we present a close-loop control framework for VSA robots leveraging recent increases in computational resources and advances in optimization algorithms. In particular, we generate reference trajectories by means of open-loop optimal control, and track these trajectories via nonlinear model predictive control in a closed-loop manner. In order to show the advantages of our proposed scheme with respect to the previous (partially open-loop) ones, extensive simulation and real-world experiments were conducted using a two link planar manipulator for a ball throwing task. The results of these experiments indicate that the closed-loop scheme outperforms the partially open loop one due to its ability to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances, while satisfying the imposed constraints.},

  abstract = {In order to realize the active and compliant motion of the robot, it is necessary to eliminate the impact caused by processing contact. A hybrid control strategy for grinding and polishing robot is proposed based on adaptive impedance control. Firstly, an electrically driven linear end effector is designed for the robot system. The macro and micro motions control model of the robot is established, by using impedance control method, which based on the contact model of the robot system and the environment. Secondly, the active compliance method is adopted to establish adaptive force control and position tracking control strategies under impact conditions. Finally, the algorithm is verified by Simulink simulation and experiment. The simulation results are as follows: The position tracking error does not exceed 0.009\,m, and the steady-state error of the force is less than 1\,N. The experimental results show that the motion curve coincides with the surface morphology of the workpiece, and the contact force is stable at 10\,±\,3\,N. The algorithm can realize more accurate position tracking and force tracking, and provide a reference for the grinding and polishing robot to realize surface processing.},

  abstract = {Passivity indices are used to measure the excess or shortage of passivity. While most of the work in the literature focuses on stability conditions for interconnected systems using passivity indices, here we focus on passivity and passivation of the feedback interconnection of two input feed-forward output-feedback (IF-OF) passive systems. The conditions are given to determine passivity indices in feedback interconnected systems. The results can be viewed as the extension of the well-known compositional property of passivity. We also consider the passivation problem which can be used to render a non-passive plant passive using a feedback interconnected passive controller. The passivity indices of the passivated system are also determined. The results derived do not require linearity of the systems as it is commonly assumed in the literature.},
