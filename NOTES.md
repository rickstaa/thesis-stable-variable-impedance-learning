# Notes

## Main problems

- I think in the end I researched a very fundamental question that has a different solution depending on the task. This made writing a literature review about it very hard. I should have scoped my question more. 
- I had a hard time creating a logical structure and sections.

## Things that are still a bit unclear

I think after having researched this question for such a long time I really have a good picture of what is used to ensure stability in variable impedance learning. There are however some things that are not fully clear:
    - Sometimes a paper proofs stability but doesn't say anything about the stability when in interaction. Does this mean that I-S stability is not proven in these papers (Duan et al. 2019)?
    - I'm not sure if the DMP force coupling really ensures stability. Why do papers like Duo et al 2022 use Kronander on top of DMP if they are stable?
    - With admittance controllers stability I-O stability is proven through Lyapunov analysis but nothing is said about passivity.
    - Does kronander's constraint really only proof stability of the Impedance controller in free-motion (see Duo et al. 2022).
